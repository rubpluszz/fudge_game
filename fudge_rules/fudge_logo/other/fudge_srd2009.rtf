It also uses words rather than numbers to describe character traits. For example, a character might be a Great swordsman rather than a "14th level fighter." Combined with simple action resolution, Fudge's descriptive nature makes ideal it for novice players. Fudge is also flexible enough to satisfy experienced role-players. There are no artificial limits placed on character creation; any character the player can imagine can be described in Fudge terms. (The GM has final say over whether or not a character is acceptable in a given game.)\par The basic Fudge rules contain no campaign world information (except for a few examples). But the game's flexibility allows it to be easily used with nearly any other role-playing game's campaign world - and, of course, with Gamemasters' own personal creations.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Some Highlights of Fudge}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 No Fixed Attributes.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  The GM chooses attributes that match the genre played and suit individual taste. A GM designing a simple Fudge game may choose only two attributes (Body and Mind, for instance), or may dispense with attributes entirely and have a character's abilities entirely defined by skills, gifts, and faults. Another Gamemaster may choose 6 attributes, or 10, or more. There are a lot of attributes to choose from.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Skill-driven system.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  The GM selects the skills, whether they are broadly defined skill groups or finely defined individual skills.

She may also grant \ldblquote free\rdblquote  gifts, or require one or more faults. The player can then spend two free levels to raise an attribute from Fair to Great, for instance; or sacrifice a number of levels to gain a gift, or give his character a fault in return for levels to apply somewhere else. \par The trading \ldblquote values\rdblquote  of various traits and trait levels are:\par \par 1 attribute level = 3 skill levels\par 1 gift = 6 skill levels\par 1 gift = 2 attribute levels\par 1 gift = 1 fault\par Scale \emdash  Strength and Mass\par \par Some characters or creatures have certain attributes that are way beyond the human norm. Prime examples include Strength, Mass, and Speed. Such attributes are rated in Scale, which acts as a modifier in interactions between creatures or items of different Scale.\par In a human-based game, Human Scale is 0. A race of greater-than-human average strength would be Scale +1 Strength or more, while a race of lesser average strength would be Scale \endash 1 Strength or less. Individuals are then of Fair or Good Strength, etc., relative to those of their own Scale. \par In a \ldblquote Bunnies\rdblquote  game, where the player characters are rabbits, Rabbit Scale would be 0, while Human Scale would likely be +7. In a \ldblquote Mecha\rdblquote  game, where the player characters were giant robots, Mecha Scale would be 0, while Human Scale would depend on the actual size difference between the Mechs and humans; a Human Scale of \endash 15 relative to the Mecha Scale of 0 would not be unreasonable.\par To calculate appropriate Strength/Mass Scale values, figure that each level of Strength Scale represents an increase of about 1.5 times the Strength and Mass of the previous Scale level. This is because the Fudge core rules define each level of Strength (from Terrible to Superb) to be 1.5 times stronger than the previous level. (This progression isn\rquote t necessarily true for other attributes. Superb Dexterity is only about twice as good as Fair Dexterity, and each level of Speed is 1.2 times faster than the previous level.) Strength Scale increases at the same rate: a Scale 1, Fair Strength individual is 1.5 times stronger than a Scale 0, Fair Strength individual.\par Note that Scale 1 Fair Strength is not exactly equal to a Scale 0 Good Strength \emdash  Scale really measures Mass, or Density, and affects how easily a creature may be hurt. A Scale 1 Fair Strength fighter has an advantage over a Scale 0 Good Strength fighter, even though their Strengths are equal. The Scale 1 fighter is less affected by the other\rquote s damage due to his greater mass.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 Action Resolution\par }\pard \fi187\sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For any action the player character wishes to perform, the GM must determine which trait is tested.

Superb, the average human will have an attribute at Fair.\par Skill: any trait that isn\rquote t an attribute, but can be improved through practice.

Are skills broad categories such as \ldblquote Social skills,\rdblquote  or moderately broad abilities, such as \ldblquote Inspire People, Parley, and Market Savvy,\rdblquote  or are they specific abilities such as \ldblquote Barter, Seduce, Repartee, Persuade, Fast-Talk, Bully, Grovel, Carouse, Flatter, Bribe,\rdblquote  etc.?\par \par Examples of Skill Depth:\par Animal Skills\tab Riding\tab Riding Horses\par \tab \tab \tab Riding Camels\par \tab \tab \tab Riding Elephants\par \tab \tab \tab Driving Oxen\par \tab \tab Driving\tab Driving Mules & Horses\par \tab \tab \tab Driving Dogs\par \tab \tab \tab Grooming\par \tab \tab Care\tab Feeding\par \tab \tab \tab Breeding\tab \par \tab \tab \tab Veterinary\tab First Aid\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Diagnosis\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Medicine\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Surgery\par \par An attribute is, in some ways, a very broad skill group, and skills may be ignored altogether if desired.\par Combat skills require special consideration. The broadest possible category is simply that: Combat Skills. A broad range breaks that down to Melee Weapons, Unarmed Combat, and Missile Weapons. A somewhat narrower approach would break down Melee Weapons into Close Combat Melee Weapons (knives, blackjacks, etc.), One-handed Melee Weapons (one-handed swords, axes, maces, etc.) and Two-handed Melee Weapons (polearms, spears, battle-axes, two-handed swords, etc.). Or, for a precise list of skills, each group in parentheses could be listed as a separate skill; a character skilled at using a broadsword knows nothing about using a saber, for example.\par Each choice has its merits. Broad skill groups that include many sub-skills make for an easy character sheet and fairly competent characters, while specific skills allow fine-tuning a character to a precise degree.\par See Section 6.3, Character Examples, for an idea of how broadly or finely skills can be defined in a game.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 1.33  Gifts\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 A gift is a positive trait that doesn\rquote t seem to fit the Terrible ... Fair ... Superb scale that attributes and skills fall into. However, this will vary from GM to GM: a photographic memory is a gift to one GM, while it is a Superb Memory attribute to another. Some GMs will define Charisma as an attribute, while others define it as a gift. To one Gamemaster, a character either has Night Vision or he doesn\rquote t; another will allow characters to take different levels of it. A Gamemaster may not even have gifts in her game at all.\par Alternatively, gifts can come in levels, but the levels don\rquote t necessarily coincide with the levels used by other traits. For example, Status might be three- or four-tiered, or even nine-tiered instead of fitting into the seven levels of attributes and skills. Wealth might come only in five different levels \emdash  whatever each GM desires.\par Supernormal powers, such as the ability to cast magic spells, fly, read minds, etc., are technically powerful gifts, but are handled separately in Chapter 2. Likewise, traits above the human norm, such as a super strong fantasy or alien race, are treated by definition as supernormal powers.\par In general, if a gift isn\rquote t written on the character sheet, the character doesn\rquote t have it.\par Some possible gifts include:\par Absolute Direction; Always keeps his cool; Ambidextrous; Animal Empathy; Attractive; Beautiful speaking voice; Bonus to one aspect of an attribute; Combat Reflexes; Contacts in police force; Danger Sense; Extraordinary Speed; Healthy Constitution; Keen senses; Literate; Lucky; Many people owe him favors; Never disoriented in zero Gravity; Never forgets a name/face/whatever; Night Vision; Patron; Perfect Timing; Peripheral Vision; Quick Reflexes; Rank; Rapid Healing; Reputation as Hero; Scale; Sense of empathy; Single-minded (+1 to any lengthy task); Status; Strong Will; Tolerant; Tough Hide (\endash 1 to damage) Wealth; etc.\par See also Section 6.3, Character Examples, for examples of different gifts. Many others are possible.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 1.34  Faults\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Faults are anything that makes life more difficult for a character. The primary faults are those that restrict a character\rquote s actions or earn him a bad reaction from chance-met NPCs. Various attitudes, neuroses and phobias are faults; so are physical disabilities and social stigmas. There are heroic faults, too: a code of honor and inability to tell a lie restrict your actions significantly, but are not signs of flawed personality.\par Some sample faults: Absent-Minded; Addiction; Ambitious; Amorous heartbreaker; Bloodlust; Blunt and tactless; Bravery indistinguishable from foolhardiness; Can\rquote t resist having the last word; Code of Ethics limits actions; Code of Honor; Compulsive Behavior; Coward; Curious; Finicky; Easily Distractible; Enemy; Fanatic patriot; Full of bluff and bluster and machismo; Garrulous; Getting old; Glutton; Goes Berserk if Wounded; Gossip; Greedy; Gullible; Humanitarian (helps the needy for no pay); Idealist (not grounded in reality); Indecisive; Intolerant; Jealous of Anyone Getting More Attention; Lazy; Loyal to Companions; Manic-Depressive; Melancholy; Multiple Personality; Must obey senior officers; Nosy; Obsession; Outlaw; Overconfident; Owes favors; Phobias; Poor; Practical Joker; Quick-Tempered; Quixotic; Self-defense Pacifist; Socially awkward; Soft-hearted; Stubborn; Quick to take offense; Unlucky; Vain; Violent when enraged; Vow; Worry Wart; Zealous behavior; etc.\par See also Section 6.3, Character Examples, for examples of different faults. Many others are possible.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 1.35  Personality\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 A character\rquote s personality may be represented by one or more traits, or it can be written out as character background or description.\par As an example of the first case, courage is an attribute, a gift, or even a fault. As an attribute, Superb Courage or Terrible Courage has an obvious meaning. As a gift, obvious bravery gives the character a positive reaction from people he meets (assuming they see him being courageous, or have heard of his deeds, of course).\par However, both Very Courageous and Very Cowardly can be faults because they can limit a character\rquote s actions. A courageous character might not run away from a fight even if it were in his best interest, while a cowardly one would have a hard time staying in a fight even if he stood to gain by staying.\par Or a character\rquote s level of courage might not be a quantified trait at all, but something the player simply decides. \ldblquote Moose is very brave,\rdblquote  a player jots down, and that is that. It doesn\rquote t have to count as a high attribute, gift, or fault.\par A player should ask the GM how she wants to handle specific personality traits. If the player describes his character in detail, the GM can easily decide which personality traits are attributes, gifts, or faults. However they are handled, most characters benefit by having their personalities fleshed out.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 1.36  Fudge Points\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Fudge Points are meta-game gifts that may be used to buy \ldblquote luck\rdblquote  during a game \emdash  they let the players fudge a game result. These are \ldblquote meta-game\rdblquote  gifts because they operate at the player-GM level, not character-character level. Not every GM will allow Fudge Points \emdash  those who prefer realistic games should probably not use them.\par The GM sets the starting number of Fudge Points. The recommended range is from one to five. Unused Fudge Points are saved up for the next gaming session. Each player may get an additional number each gaming session. (This is also set by the GM, and may or may not equal the starting level.) Alternately, the GM may simply allow Experience Points (EP) to be traded for Fudge Points at a rate appropriate for the campaign: 3 EP = 1 Fudge Point, down to 1 EP = Fudge Point.\par Fudge Points can be used in many ways, depending on what level on the realistic-legendary scale the game is played at. Here are some suggested ways to use them \emdash  the GM can create her own uses, of course. A GM may allow as few or many of these options as she wishes \emdash  the players should ask her before assuming they can do something with Fudge Points.\par 1) Spending a Fudge Point may accomplish an Unopposed action automatically and with panache \emdash  good for impressing members of the appropriate sex, and possibly avoiding injury in the case of dangerous actions. The GM may veto this use of Fudge Points for actions with a Difficulty Level of Beyond Superb. The GM may disallow this option for an Opposed action, such as combat.\par 2) A player may spend one Fudge Point to alter a die roll one level, up or down as desired. The die roll can be either one the player makes, or one the GM makes that directly concerns the player\rquote s character.\par 3) A player may spend one Fudge Point to declare that wounds aren\rquote t as bad as they first looked. This reduces the intensity of each wound by one or two levels (a Hurt result becomes a Scratch, for example, or even a Very Hurt becomes a Scratch). Or it can mean that any one wound (or more), regardless of level, is just a Scratch. This latter option may cost more than one Fudge point. The GM can restrict this to outside of combat time.\par 4) A player may spend one (or more) Fudge Points to get an automatic +4 result, without having to roll the dice. This use is available in Opposed actions, if allowed.\par 5) For appropriately legendary games, a GM-set number of Fudge Points can be spent to ensure a favorable coincidence. (This is always subject to GM veto, of course.) For example, if the PCs are in a maximum security prison, perhaps one of the guards turns out to be the cousin of one of the PCs \emdash  and lets them escape! Or the captain of the fishing boat rescuing the PCs turns out to be someone who owes a favor to one of them, and is willing to take them out of his way to help them out\u8230\'c9 And so on. This option should cost a lot of Fudge Points, except in certain genres where bizarre coincidences are the norm.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 1.4  Allocating Traits\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Character creation in Fudge assumes the players will design their characters, rather than leaving attributes and other traits to chance. The GM may allow randomly determined traits if she desires \emdash  a suggested method is given in Section 1.8, Random Character Creation.\par There are no mandatory traits in Fudge. The GM should inform the players which traits she expects to be most important, and the players may suggest others to the GM for her approval. The GM may even make a template, if desired \emdash  a collection of traits she deems important (with room for customization) \emdash  and let the players define the level of each trait. See Section 6.12, Templates.\par When a character is created, the player should define as many character traits as he finds necessary \emdash  which may or may not coincide with a GM-determined list. If a player adds an attribute the GM deems unnecessary, the GM may treat that attribute as simply a description of the character. She may require a roll against a different attribute than the player has in mind, and the player must abide by her decision.\par As an example, a certain GM decides she wants characters to have a general Dexterity attribute. A player takes Good Dexterity for his PC, but wants to show that the character is better at whole body dexterity than at manual dexterity. So he writes: Great Agility and Fair Manual Dexterity. However, the GM can ignore these distinctions, and simply require a Dexterity roll, since that is the trait she has chosen. (She can average the PC-chosen levels, or simply select one of them.) Of course, she can also allow him to roll on the attributes he has created.\par In Fudge, a character with a trait at Fair will succeed at ordinary tasks 62% of the time \emdash  there is usually no need to create a superstar. In fact, Great is just that: great! Superb should be reserved for the occasional trait in which your character is the best he\rquote s ever met.\par Any trait that is not defined at character creation will be at a default level:\par For attributes: Fair.\par For most skills: Poor (easier skills are at Mediocre, while harder ones are at Terrible). A skill default means untrained, or close to it. However, it is possible to take a skill at Terrible (below the default level for most skills), which implies an ineptitude worse than untrained.\par For most gifts, supernormal powers and certain GM-defined skills: Non-Existent. (That is, the default is non-existent. The trait itself exists in some character, somewhere.)\par Each player should expect the GM to modify his character after creation \emdash  it\rquote s the nature of the game. The GM should expect to review each character before play. It would, in fact, be best if the characters were made in the presence of the GM so she can answer questions during the process.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 1.5  Subjective Character Creation\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 An easy way to create a character in Fudge is simply to write down everything about the character that you feel is important. Any attribute or skill should be rated using one of the levels Terrible through Superb (see Section 1.2, Fudge Trait Levels).\par It may be easiest, though, if the GM supplies a template of attributes she\rquote ll be using. See Section 6.3, Character Examples, for template ideas.\par The GM may also tell the player in advance that his character can be Superb in a certain number of attributes, Great in so many others, and Good in yet another group. For example, in an epic-style game with eight attributes, the GM allows one Superb attribute, two Greats, and three Goods. In a more realistic game, this is one Superb, one Great, and two Goods.\par This can apply to skills, too: one Superb skill, two Great skills, and six Good skills is a respectable number for a realistic campaign, while two Superbs, three Greats, and ten Goods is quite generous, even in a highly cinematic game.\par The GM may also simply limit the number of skills a character can take at character creation: 10, 15, or 20 are possible choices.\par Gifts and faults can be restricted this way, also. For example, a GM allows a character to have two gifts, but he must take at least three faults. Taking another fault allows another gift, or another skill at Great, and so on.\par These limitations help the player define the focus of the character a bit better: what is his best trait (what can he do best)?\par A simple \ldblquote two lower for one higher\rdblquote  trait-conversion mechanic can also be used. If the GM allows one Superb attribute, for example, the player may forego that and take two attributes at Great, instead. The converse may also be allowed: a player may swap two skills at Good to get one at Great.\par Example: a player wants a Jack-of-all-trades character, and the GM has limits of one Superb skill, two Great skills and six Good skills. The player trades the one Superb skill limit for two Great skills: he can now take four skills at Great. However, he trades all four Great skills in order to have eight more Good skills. His character can now have 14 skills at Good, but none at any higher levels.\par In the Subjective Character Creation system, it is easy to use both broad and narrow skill groups, as appropriate for the character. In these cases, a broad skill group is assumed to contain the phrase, \ldblquote except as listed otherwise.\rdblquote \par For example, a player wishes to play the science officer of a starship. He decides this character has spent so much time studying the sciences, that he\rquote s weak in most physical skills. So on his character sheet he could simply write:\par \par Physical Skills: Poor\par \par He also decides that his character\rquote s profession would take him out of the ship in vacuum quite a bit, to examine things. So he\rquote d have to be somewhat skilled at zero-G maneuvering. So he then adds:\par \par Zero-G Maneuvering: Good\par \par Even though this is a physical skill, it is not at Poor because he specifically listed it as an exception to the broad category.\par When the character write-up is done, the player and GM meet and discuss the character. If the GM feels the character is too potent for the campaign she has in mind, she may ask the player to reduce the character\rquote s power \emdash  see Section 1.9, Minimizing Abuse.\par The GM may also need to suggest areas that she sees as being too weak \emdash  perhaps she has a game situation in mind that will test a trait the player didn\rquote t think of. Gentle hints, such as \ldblquote Does he have any social skills?\rdblquote  can help the player through the weak spots. Of course, if there are multiple players, other PCs can compensate for an individual PC\rquote s weaknesses. In this case, the question to the whole group is then, \ldblquote Does anyone have any social skills?\rdblquote \par Instead of the player writing up the character in terms of traits and levels, he can simply write out a prose description of his character. This requires the GM to translate everything into traits and appropriate levels, but that\rquote s not hard to do if the description is well written. This method actually produces some of the best characters.\par \par An example:\par GM: \ldblquote I see you rate Captain Wallop\rquote s blaster skill highly, and also his piloting and gunnery, but I\rquote m only allowing one Superb skill \emdash  which is he best at?\rdblquote \par Player: \ldblquote Blaster!\rdblquote \par GM: \ldblquote Okay, Superb Blaster. That would then be Great Piloting and Great Gunnery, all right? That leaves you with two more skills to be at Great, since I allow four to start out. Hmmm \emdash  I notice he successfully penetrated the main Khothi hive and rescued the kidnapped ambassador \emdash  that sounds like a Great Ability to Move Quietly to me \emdash  is that accurate, or would you describe it as some other ability?\rdblquote \par Player: \ldblquote Uh, no \emdash  sorry, I didn\rquote t write that clearly enough. He disguised himself and pretended to be a Khothi worker!\rdblquote \par GM: \ldblquote Ah, I see! How about Great Disguise skill and Great Acting ability, then? And he must be Good at the Khothi language, right?\rdblquote \par And so on.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 1.6  Objective Character Creation\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For those who don\rquote t mind counting numbers a bit, the following method creates interesting and well-balanced characters.\par In this system, all traits start at default level. The GM then allows a number of free levels the players may use to raise selected traits to higher levels. Players may then lower certain traits in order to raise others even further. Finally, a player may opt to trade some levels of one trait type (such as attributes) for another (skills, for example). The whole process insures that no single character will dominate every aspect of play.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 1.61  Attributes\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 A GM using the Objective Character Creation system should decide how many attributes she deems necessary in the campaign. She can choose to leave it up to each player, if she wishes. Players then have a number of free attribute levels equal to half the number of attributes (round up). For example, if she selects four attributes, each player starts with two free levels he can use to raise his character\rquote s attributes.\par For a more high-powered game, the GM may allow a number of free levels equal to the number of attributes chosen.\par All attributes are considered to be Fair until the player raises or lowers them. The cost of raising or lowering an attribute is:\par \tab +3  \tab Superb\par \tab +2  \tab Great\par \tab +1  \tab Good\par  \tab 0  \tab Fair\par \tab \endash 1  \tab Mediocre\par \tab \endash 2  \tab Poor\par \tab \endash 3  \tab Terrible\par \par Thus, a player may raise his Strength attribute (which is Fair by default) to Good by spending one free attribute level. He could then spend another free level to raise Strength again to Great. This would exhaust his free levels if there were only four attributes \emdash  but he would have one more if there were six attributes, and eight more free levels if there were 20 attributes.\par When the free attribute levels have been exhausted, an attribute can be raised further by lowering another attribute an equal amount. (See also Section 1.64, Trading Traits.) From the previous example, Strength can be raised one more level (to Superb) if the player lowers the character\rquote s Charm to Mediocre to compensate for the increase in Strength.\par If the GM allows the players to choose their own attributes, she may simply tell them to take half as many free levels as attributes they choose. If a player chooses an attribute and leaves it at Fair, that attribute does not count towards the total of attributes which determines the amount of free levels. That is, a player cannot simply add twelve attributes, all at Fair, in order to get six more free levels to raise the others with. GM-mandated attributes left at Fair do count when determining the number of free levels, though.\par As an interesting possibility for those who want attributes and skills to reflect each other accurately, do not let the players adjust attribute levels at all. Instead, they select only skill levels, gifts and faults for their characters. When the character is done, the GM can then determine what attribute levels make sense for the skill levels chosen, and discuss it with the player.\par Example: a character is made with many combat and wilderness skills, but no social skills. He also has a smattering of intelligence skills. The GM decides that this character has Strength, Dexterity and Health of Great from spending a lot of time outdoors, practicing with weapons, etc. She will even let the player choose one to be at Superb, if desired. Perception is probably Good, since wilderness survival depends on it. Any social attribute is Mediocre at best \emdash  possibly even Poor \emdash  while Intelligence is Mediocre or Fair. If the player objects to the low Intelligence ranking, the GM can point out that the character hasn\rquote t spent much time in skills that hone Intelligence, and if he wants his character\rquote s IQ to be higher, he should adjust his skill list.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 1.62  Skills\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 In the Objective Character Creation system, each player has a number of free skill levels with which to raise his skills. Suggested limits are:\par \par For Extremely Broad Skill Groups: 15 levels.\par For Moderately Broad Skill Groups: 30 levels.\par For Specific Skills: 40 to 60 levels.\par \par Ask the GM for the allotted amount, which will give you a clue as to how precisely to define your skills. Of course, the GM may choose any number that suits her, such as 23, 42, or 74\u8230\'c9. See Section 6.3, Character Examples. Gamemasters may devise their own skill lists to choose from \emdash  some possibilities are included in the skill lists on page 126.\par Most skills have a default value of Poor unless the player raises or lowers them \emdash  see Section 1.4, Allocating Traits.\par Certain skills have a default of non-existent. These would include Languages, Karate, Nuclear Physics, or Knowledge of Aztec Rituals, which must be studied to be known at all. When a character studies such a skill (puts a level into it at character creation, or experience points later in the game), the level he gets it at depends on how hard it is to learn. Putting one level into learning the Spanish language, for example, would get it at Mediocre, since it\rquote s of average difficulty to learn. Nuclear Physics, on the other hand, might only be Poor or even Terrible with only one level put into it. It would take four levels just to get such a skill at Fair, for example.\par For ease in character creation, use the following table:\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Cost of Skills in Objective Character Creation\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Very\par \tab \tab Easy\tab Most\tab Hard\tab Hard\par Terrible\tab \tab \endash 2\tab \endash 1\tab 0\tab 1\par Poor\tab \tab \endash 1\tab 0\tab 1\tab 2\par Mediocre\tab 0\tab 1\tab 2\tab 3\par Fair\tab \tab 1\tab 2\tab 3\tab 4\par Good\tab \tab 2\tab 3\tab 4\tab 5\par Great\tab \tab 3\tab 4\tab 5\tab 6\par Superb\tab \tab 4\tab 5\tab 6\tab 7\par \par Easy = Cost of GM-Determined Easy Skills\par Most = Cost of Average Skill\par Hard = Cost of GM-Determined Hard Skills\par VH = Cost of GM-Determined Very Hard Skills\par (usually related to Supernormal Powers)\par \par As in the Subjective Character Creation system, the GM may limit the number of Superb and Great skills each character may have at character creation. For a highly cinematic or super-powered game, no limit is necessary. For example, the GM sets a limit of one Superb skill, three or four Great skills, and eight or so Good skills. These limits can be exceeded through character development, of course. See Section 6.3, Character Examples.\par Once the free levels are used up, a skill must be dropped one level (from the default Poor to Terrible) to raise another skill one level. (See also Section 1.64, Trading Traits.) All choices are subject to GM veto, of course.\par It is possible to mix different breadths of skill groupings. A GM who has little interest in combat can simply choose Unarmed Combat, Melee Weapons and Ranged Weapons as the only three combat skills. But this does not stop her from using all the individual Social skills (and many more) listed as examples on page 126. If this option is chosen, the broad groups cost double the levels of the narrower groups.\par Mixing skill group sizes within the same areas is awkward in the Objective Character Creation system. For example, it is difficult to have a generic Thief Skills group and also have individual skills of lockpicking, pick-pocketing, palming, security-device dismantling, etc. If she does wish to do this, then the broad skill group in this case has a maximum limit of Good, and triple cost to raise \emdash  or more, if the GM so mandates.\par If the GM is using broad groups, a player may raise a specific skill (such as Poker, for example, instead of general Gambling skill). A player would give his character a specific skill when the GM is using broad-based skill groups to fit a character concept. Do not expect the character to be equally adept with the other skills in the group. This would be true for Groo* the Wanderer, for instance, who would simply raise Sword skill, even if the GM is using the broad term Melee Weapons as a skill group. Groo would have, in fact, a Poor rating with all other Melee weapons, and this would accurately reflect the character.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 1.63  Gifts & Faults\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 If the GM has gifts in her game, she may allow player characters to start with one or two free gifts \emdash  more for epic campaigns.

Some examples:\par Types of Powers: a given campaign may allow magic, psi, superpowers, etc., or some combination of the above. The GM also needs to decide how finely a supernormal power is subdivided. Is ESP a generic Power, or is it split into separate Powers such as Precognition and Clairvoyance? Is magic subdivided into spells, or groups of spells (such as elemental magic) or simply the ability to break the laws of nature in any way that can be imagined? And so on.\par Number of Powers allowed: the GM may set the number of Powers allowed per character. The number may range from one to 20 \emdash  or even more. Multiple Powers per character are especially likely in a fantasy campaign where individual spells are separate Powers.\par Drawbacks of Powers: in some campaigns, using a Power may bear a penalty or have some drawback. Typical drawbacks include mental or physical fatigue, lengthy time requirements, unreliable or uncontrollable results, and undesirable side effects (such as loud noises, bad smells, and the like). Some Powers will only work under certain conditions or with certain materials, or are limited to a certain number of uses per day \emdash  or month. Others may be risky to the character, affecting physical or mental health.

For example, the superpower Flight allows a character to fly, and usually no skill roll is needed. But the ability to make intricate maneuvers in close combat without slamming into a wall requires a roll against a Flying skill. (The GM may ignore this and simply say that no roll is needed for any flying maneuver with a Flight Power.)\par Another common skill is Throwing: hurling balls of fire or bolts of energy at a foe. Or the GM might rule that being able to aim and accurately release such energy comes with the power for free: no roll needed, it automatically hits the target every time unless the target makes a Good Dodge roll (see Chapter 4, Combat, Wounds & Healing).\par This can be especially true with magic: the ability to cast spells at all may be a gift, but to do it right is a skill, or even many different skills.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 2.23  Combat Powers\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 If a supernormal power can be used to attack a foe, the GM must determine the strength of the Power for damage purposes \emdash  preferably during character creation. An offensive Power is usually handled as a propelled weapon, such as a gun, or as being equivalent to a certain melee weapon. This can just be expressed in terms of damage, though, such as Ball of Fire, +6 damage, or large Claws, +3 damage. (See Section 4.54, Sample Wound Factors List.)\par In the case of a magical or superhero attack, the more potent the attack, the greater the power required, or perhaps the greater the strain on the character who uses it. This can be a penalty to the skill level, greater fatigue, and/or some other disadvantage.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 2.3 Non-humans\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Some campaigns will have characters (or animals, monsters, etc.) with traits beyond the human norm. In particular, characters with Strength and Speed well above or below the human range are common in role-playing games. Examples include giants, superheroes, pixies, aliens, ogres, intelligent rabbits, robots, etc.\par In Fudge, Strength, Mass and Speed are rated by the GM in terms of Scale for different races. Most other traits that may be different for non-humans are handled with a Racial Bonus or Penalty rather than being on a different Scale \emdash  see Section 2.35. Of course, the GM may assign any trait she wishes in terms of Scale.\par Humans are of Scale 0, unless some other race is the game-world norm. (E.g., if all the PCs are playing pixies or giants. In these cases, the PCs\rquote  race is Scale 0, and humans would be a different Scale.) Non-human races can have a positive or negative number for Scale, depending on whether they are stronger (or bigger or faster) or weaker (or smaller or slower) than humans.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 2.31  Strength and Mass\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The word Scale used alone always means Strength/ Mass Scale in Fudge \emdash  any other Scale, such as Speed, or Strength without Mass, will be defined as such.\par Each level of Strength (from Terrible to Superb) is defined to be 1.5 times stronger than the previous level. A character with Good Strength is thus 1.5 times as strong as a character with Fair Strength. Note that this progression is not necessarily true for any other attribute. There is a wider range of strength in humans than dexterity, for example: Superb Dexterity is only about twice as good as Fair Dexterity.\par Strength Scale increases in the same way: a Scale 1, Fair Strength individual is 1.5 times stronger than a Scale 0, Fair Strength individual. This holds for each increase in Scale: a Scale 10 Superb Strength creature is 1.5 times stronger than a Scale 9 Superb Strength creature, for example.\par At this point, it is tempting to say that a Scale 1 Fair Strength is equal to a Scale 0 Good Strength. This is true for Strength, but not for Mass. Scale really measures Mass, or Density, and Strength just goes along for the ride.\par In Fudge, Mass has a specific meaning: how wounds affect a character. (This may or may not coincide with the scientific definition of Mass.) It takes more human-powered hits to weaken a giant than a human, for example. She may not really be a healthy giant, but her sheer bulk means that human-sized sword strokes don\rquote t do as much damage relative to her as they would to a human \emdash  unless they hit a vital spot, of course. Likewise, a pixie can be healthy and robust, but not survive a single kick from a human. The difference is Mass, and the strength related to it.\par A Scale 1 Fair Strength fighter has an advantage over a Scale 0 Good Strength fighter, even though their Strengths are equal. The Scale 1 fighter is less affected by the other\rquote s damage due to his mass. Therefore, do not blithely equate Scale 0 Good with Scale 1 Fair.\par Of course, the GM may envision a less massive but harder to kill race than humans. This is best handled by a Racial Bonus (Section 2.35), either as a Toughness Gift (Tough Hide, or Density \emdash  either one would subtract from damage), or by a bonus to Damage Capacity.\par The GM may decide that increased Mass does not necessarily mean of greater size \emdash  the race may be of denser material. Dwarves in northern European legend were derived from stone, and are hence denser than humans. Such a dwarf hits harder and shrugs off damage easier than most humans: he is Scale 1, though shorter than a human. (Of course, the GM should define dwarves\rquote  attributes and Scale to her own requirements.)\par Normally, Strength and Mass are handled by a single Scale figure. That is, if a creature is said to be Scale 7, that means Scale 7 Mass and Scale 7 Strength. Strength can vary within each race just as it can for humans. You can have Scale 10 Superb Strength Giants and Scale 10 Terrible Strength Giants. Unlike Strength, though, it is not recommended that Mass vary much within a race. If you do allow Mass to vary for an individual, it should never be worse than Mediocre or better than Good. In fact, it is far better to call Good Mass a Gift, and Mediocre Mass a fault than treat it as an attribute.\par The GM may choose to separate Strength Scale from Mass Scale. This would allow Pixies of Strength Scale \endash 6 and Mass Scale \endash 4, for example. However, combat between two Pixies would not work the same as combat between two humans. In this case, they would have a harder time hurting each other than humans would, since their Strength Scale (ability to give out damage) is lower than their Mass Scale (ability to take damage). This may actually be what she wants: a super-strong superhero who can dish out punishment but can\rquote t take it can be represented by Strength Scale 10, Mass Scale 2, for example.\par See also Section 4.58, Non-human Scale in Combat.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 2.32  Speed\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Each level of Speed (from Terrible to Superb) is defined to be 1.2 times faster than the previous level. A character with Good Speed is thus 1.2 times as fast as a character with Fair Speed. This is not the same progression as for Strength.\par Speed Scale increases in the same manner: a Scale 1, Fair Speed individual is 1.2 times faster than a Scale 0, Fair Speed individual. This holds for each increase in Scale: a Scale 10 Superb Speed animal is 1.2 times faster than a Scale 9 Superb Speed animal, for example.\par Speed is not a necessary attribute, of course, and can be ignored entirely if desired. It is included primarily for creatures and vehicles significantly faster than humans. For comparison purposes, assume a Fair Speed human can run at about 10 mph (16 kph) over some distance, provided they are in shape, of course. Sprinting short distance is somewhat faster. This comes to about 15 yards (meters) per three-second combat round.\par Note that in short races, you don\rquote t really have to roll the dice to see if someone of Superb Speed can beat someone of Good Speed \emdash  he can, and will, much more often than rolling the dice would reveal.\par The Speed Scale rises too slowly for comparing such things as race cars or space ships to human movement. In these cases, either use a rough human Scale, or simply set the average space ship at Space Ship Speed Scale 0, and rate others relative to it. Thus, the average race car will be roughly human Scale 12 \emdash  or you can simply call it Race Car Scale 0, and compare other race cars to it. A Space Ship might be Human Scale 100, or Space Ship Scale 0.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 2.33  Scale Correlations\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The Gamemaster should refer to the following table when assigning a Scale to a race. This only has to be done once, at race creation.\par First, the GM should decide how much stronger (or weaker or faster, etc.) the average member of race X is compared to the average human. For example, she decides that Ogres are three times stronger than humans, and pixies are eight times weaker (which equals 0.12 times as strong). She then needs to look up the closest numbers to these strength multipliers on the table below, and look in the corresponding Scale column to find the correct racial Strength/Mass Scales. In this example, Ogres are Scale 3 creatures, while Pixies are Scale \endash 6. (You may envision Ogres and Pixies differently, of course.)\par (See }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Miscellaneous Charts and Tables}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  for a sample Mass Scale Table with examples.)\par The Strength/Mass Scale number is figured into damage in combat, and all weapons and armor are assumed to be of the same Scale as the wielder. (These numbers have been rounded to the nearest useful number. They are only roughly 1.5 times the previous number, but close enough for game purposes.)\par Other examples: a GM reads in a Medieval text that a dragon is \ldblquote as strong as 20 warriors.\rdblquote  Looking at the table, 20 times the human norm is Scale 8. However, since the average warrior has Good strength, she chooses Scale 9 for the average dragon in her world. Of course, an individual dragon can still have Poor Strength compared to other dragons. This is simply listed as Strength Poor (\endash 2), Scale 9.\par This same GM wants PC leprechauns to be available. While they are small, she decides their magic makes them a bit stronger than their size would otherwise indicate: Scale \endash 4. So a Good Strength leprechaun is as strong as a Terrible Strength human in her world.\par The GM can also use this table to determine relative lifting strength or carrying capacity of characters or beasts if she wishes.\par The GM may require a Strength roll to lift a given object. This will depend on the Scale of the character, of course. Thus, a leprechaun might need a Good Difficulty Level Strength roll to lift a rock that a human could lift without even a roll. (See Chapter 3, Action Resolution.)\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 2.34  Cost of Scale\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 If you are using the Objective Character Creation system, each step of increased Strength/Mass Scale for a player character should cost one attribute level and one gift. This is because each level of Scale includes +1 Strength and extra Mass, which is the equivalent of the Tough Hide gift. However, a generous GM may charge less.\par In a superhero game, this gets very expensive, very quickly. An alternative method: let one supernormal power equal a certain Scale. For example, the GM allows one Power to equal Scale 4 (five times as strong as the average human). A character buys three Powers of super strength and has Scale 12 Strength. Another GM allows Scale 13 (200 times as strong as the average human) to equal one Power. Since a character with two Powers in super strength would have Scale 26 Strength (!), the GM decides to limit the amount of super strength available to one Power.\par A player then raises or lowers his character\rquote s Strength attribute to show how he compares to the average super-strong superhero. Strength can then be raised to Scale 13 Good, for example, at the cost of one attribute level.\par The GM may also allow separate Mass and Strength for superheroes (or even races). For example, the superhero mentioned in Section 2.31 with Strength Scale 10 and Mass Scale 2 would only have to pay for two gifts and ten attribute levels. Or, with a generous GM, a single supernormal power covers the entire cost.\par Other supernormal powers may have levels. Examples include Telekinesis (increased power allows greater weight to be lifted), Telepathy (increased power equals greater range), Wind Control (increased power allows such things as a jet of wind, whirlwind, or tornado), etc.\par In these cases, each level can be bought as a separate supernormal power, which is expensive. Or you could use the option given above for Scale: one supernormal power buys the supernormal ability at a middling power range, and a simple attribute (or even skill) level raises or lowers it from there.\par For Scales below the human norm, each step of Mass Scale includes a fault equivalent to Easily Wounded, and the GM may allow this to be used to balance other traits like any other fault \emdash  see Section 1.64, Trading Traits.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 2.35  Racial Bonuses and Penalties\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 There is rarely any need to use Scale for traits other than Strength, Mass and Speed. It\rquote s easy to imagine someone wanting to play a race that is slightly more intelligent than humans, but a race ten times smarter than the smartest human is so alien that it would be impossible to play. This is true for most traits \emdash  we just can\rquote t grasp such extreme differences from our world view.\par Actually, there is a way to use intelligence in Scale: in a non-quantified manner. For example, when creating a dog character, you can list:\par \par Intelligence:   Great (Scale: Dog)\par \par Since no one is able to quantify inter-species intelligence accurately, do not expect to use it comparatively. It gives an indication that, relative to other dogs, this dog has Great intelligence. The word \ldblquote Scale\rdblquote  isn\rquote t necessary \emdash  \ldblquote Great canine intelligence\rdblquote  works just as well.\par The GM should usually use Racial Bonuses or Penalties for traits other than Strength, Mass and Speed. If the GM envisions halflings as being particularly hardy, she can give them a +1 bonus to Constitution: halfling Fair Constitution equals human Good Constitution. As another example, an alien race, Cludds, have a racial penalty of \endash 1 to Intelligence.\par It is best to use trait levels relative to humans on the character sheets, though you should put the racial-relative term in brackets. (Example: Grahkesh, Intelligence Poor [Cludd Fair].) However, always list Strength relative to the character\rquote s own race, with the Scale (if other than 0), so the Mass will be accurate. See the sample character, Brogo the Halfling (Section 6.311), for an example of both racial bonus and different Scale.\par Racial bonuses and penalties can be used for any type of trait: attributes, skills, gifts, supernormal powers, or faults.\par If using the Objective Character Creation system, each level of a Racial Bonus or Penalty is usually equal to one level of the specific trait raised or lowered normally. That is, if you are granting a +1 to Agility or +1 to Perception for a race, it should cost one attribute level. If a race has a bonus of a Perfect Sense of Direction, it should cost one gift. The innate ability to fly or cast magic spells should cost one supernormal power, etc.\par If a race is at \endash 1 to all Social skills, however, this should only be worth \endash 1 skill level if you have a single skill called Social Skills. If you have many social individual social skills, it should be worth one fault. The converse is true for Bonuses that affect many skills: it should cost one or more gifts.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 2.4  Legendary Heroes\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Some genres allow human characters to develop beyond the realm of the humanly possible.

Is it a natural process, such as mana manipulation? If it does use mana, does the mage create the mana, or is it inherent in a locale? Or does the mage summon other-world entities to do his bidding? Or must the mage find a source of Power and channel it to his own ends? Or is the source of magic something altogether different?\par Can anyone learn to work magic, or is it an inherent talent (that is, does it require a supernormal power)? Are there levels of Power available, and what would having more levels mean? Is a skill also required? Of course, even if a magician must have a Power to cast spells, there may also be magic items that anyone can use \emdash  these are common in tales and legends.\par If beings are summoned, are they evil, good, neutral, confused? How do they feel about being commanded to work for the magician? Can they adversely affect the magician if he fails a spell roll? If Power is being channeled from an external source, is that source in the physical plane or astral? Is it from a living being, or contained in an inanimate object as inert energy, like a piece of coal before going into a fire?\par What is the process of using magic? Does it involve memorized spells? Physical components? Meditation? Complex and time-consuming ritual? How long does it take to cast a spell? Can a spell be read out of a book? Improvised on the spot?\par How reliable is magic? Are there any drawbacks? Any societal attitudes toward magicians? Is it common knowledge that magicians exist, or are they a secret cabal, whose doings are only whispered about in ever-changing rumors?\par Once these issues have been resolved, and the degree of magic in the game decided on, the magic system can be created using Fudge mechanics.

As a simple system, each psionic ability can be a separate supernormal power. The ability to read minds, or foresee the future, or telekinetically move an object, etc., each cost one supernormal power (two gifts). Just how powerful the psionic ability is depends on the level of psi the GM wants for the game world.

See also Section 2.34, Cost of Scale.\par In general, higher levels of Psi Powers equal greater range, or the ability to affect larger or more subjects at once, or access to a greater number of related skills (a low Telepathy Power lets you send your thoughts to another, for example, but greater Power lets you read minds, send painful waves of energy, sense emotions, and possibly even control others). A higher level might also let you use less fatigue or have a lower risk of burnout, take less time in concentration to use, or allow more uses per day, or be used in a broader range of conditions (a low ESP Power can only be accessed in a darkened room, for example, while a high Power level can be used at any time), and so on.\par The GM may also require skills to use these powers. Having the psionic ability to use telekinesis just allows you to pick an object up with your mental powers, and move it crudely about.

This is most commonly used with Reaction and damage rolls, but can be used elsewhere as needed. For example, the players ask the GM if there are any passersby on the street at the moment \emdash  they\rquote re worried about witnesses.

It gives results from \endash 4 to +4 quickly and easily, without intruding into role-playing or requiring complex math or a table.\par Fudge dice are six-sided dice with two sides marked +1, two sides marked \endash 1, and two sides marked 0. They are commercially available from Grey Ghost Press, Inc. \emdash  see http://www.fudgerpg.com.\par You can make your own Fudge dice easily enough. Simply get four normal white d6s. Using a permanent marker, color two sides of each die green, two sides red, and leave the other two sides white. When the ink has dried, spray the dice lightly with clear matte finish to prevent the ink from staining your hands. You now have 4dF: the green sides = +1, the red sides = \endash 1, and the white sides = 0.\par (While you can try to play with normal d6s \emdash  reading: 1,2 = \endash 1;  3,4 =  0; 5,6 = +1 \emdash  this is not recommended. It takes too much effort, and intrudes into role-playing. 4dF is functionally equivalent to 4d3\endash 8, but this is also not recommended for the same reason, even if you have d6s labeled 1-3 twice.)\par To use Fudge dice, simply roll four of them, and total the amount. Since a +1 and a \endash 1 cancel each other, remove a +1 and \endash 1 from the table, and the remaining two dice are easy to read no matter what they are. (Example: if you roll +1, +1, 0, \endash 1, remove the \endash 1 and one of the +1s, as together they equal 0. The remaining two dice, +1 and 0, are easily added to +1.) If there is no opposing pair of +1 and \endash 1 dice, remove any zeros and the remaining dice are again easy to read.\par The result of a die roll is a number between \endash 4 and +4. At the top of the character sheet, there should be a simple chart of the attribute levels, such as:\par \par Superb\par Great\par Good\par Fair\par Mediocre\par Poor\par Terrible\par \par To determine the result of an action, simply put your finger on your trait level, then move it up (for plus results) or down (for minus results).\par Example: Nathaniel, who has a Good Bow Skill, is shooting in an archery contest. The player rolls 4dF, using the procedure described above. If he rolls a 0, he gets a result equal to Nathaniel\rquote s skill: Good, in this case. If he rolls a +1, however, he gets a Great result, since Great is one level higher than his Good Archery skill. If he rolls a \endash 3, unlucky Nathaniel has just made a Poor shot.\par It is not always necessary to figure the exact rolled degree. If you only need to know whether or not a character succeeded at something, it is usually sufficient for the player simply to announce the appropriate trait level and the die roll result. The game goes much faster this way. For example, a player wants his character, Captain Wallop of the Space Patrol, to fly between two asteroids that are fairly close together. The GM says this requires a Great Difficulty Level Piloting roll and asks the player to roll the dice. The player looks up Captain Wallop\rquote s Piloting skill, which is Great, and rolls a +2 result. He simply announces \ldblquote Great +2\rdblquote  as the result. This answer is sufficient \emdash  the GM knows that Captain Wallop not only succeeded at the task, but didn\rquote t even come close to damaging his craft.\par Of course, there are many times when you want to know exactly how well the character did, even if it\rquote s not a matter of being close. If the character is composing a poem, for example, and his Poetry skill is Fair, you will want to figure out what \ldblquote Fair+2\rdblquote  means: he just wrote a Great poem! There are many other instances where degrees of success is more important than merely knowing success/failure.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 3.22  Other Dice Techniques\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For those who don\rquote t want to make or buy Fudge dice, three different options are available:\par 4d6: this method requires 2d6 of one color (or size) and 2d6 of another color or size. First declare which two dice are the positive dice, and which two the negative, then roll all four dice. Do not add the dice in this system. Instead, remove from the table all but the lowest die (or dice, if more than one has the same lowest number showing). If the only dice left on the table are the same color, that is the result: a positive die with a \ldblquote 1\rdblquote  showing is a +1, for example. If there are still dice of both colors showing, the result is \ldblquote 0\rdblquote .\par Examples (p = positive die, n = negative die): you roll p4, p3, n3, n3. The lowest number is a 3, so the p4 is removed, leaving p3, n3 and n3. Since there are both positive and negative dice remaining, the result is 0. On another roll, you get p1, p1, n2, n4. Remove the highest numbers, n2 and n4. This leaves only positive dice, so the result is +1, since a \ldblquote 1\rdblquote  is showing on a positive die, and there are no negative dice on the table.\par 3d6: Roll 3 six-sided dice. Add the numbers and look up the results on the table below. The table is so small that it could easily fit on a character sheet. Example: a roll of 3, 3, 6 is a sum of 12. Looking up 12 on the table yields a result of +1.\par \par Rolled:  3-4\tab 5\tab 6-7\tab 8-9\tab 10-11\tab 12-13\tab 14-15\tab 16\tab 17-18\par Result:   \endash 4\tab \endash 3\tab \endash 2\tab \endash 1\tab +0\tab +1\tab +2\tab +3\tab +4\par \par d%: roll two ten-sided dice, having first declared which will be the \ldblquote tens\rdblquote  digit. Read the tens die and the ones die as a number from 1 to 100 (01 = 1, but 00 = 100), and consult the table below, which should be printed on the character sheet:\par \par Rolled:   1\tab 2-6\tab 7-18\tab 19-38\tab 39-62\tab 63-82\tab 83-94\tab 95-99\tab 00\par Result:  \endash 4\tab \endash 3\tab \endash 2\tab \endash 1\tab +0\tab +1\tab +2\tab +3\tab +4\par \par Of course, the GM may customize this table as she wishes. These numbers were chosen to match 4dF, which the author feels is an ideal spread for Fudge.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 3.23  Success Rates\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The following table is provided so that players can better evaluate their chances of success.\par \tab Chance\tab 4dF\par \tab of achieving\tab or d%\tab 3d6\tab 4d6\par \tab +5 or better:\tab \emdash \tab \emdash \tab 0.2%\par \tab +4 or better:\tab 1%\tab 2%\tab 2%\par \tab +3 or better:\tab 6%\tab 5%\tab 7%\par \tab +2 or better:\tab 18%\tab 16%\tab 18%\par \tab +1 or better:\tab 38%\tab 38%\tab 39%\par \tab   0 or better:\tab 62%\tab 62%\tab 61%\par \tab \endash 1 or better:\tab 82%\tab 84%\tab 82%\par \tab \endash 2 or better:\tab 94%\tab 95%\tab 93%\par \tab \endash 3 or better:\tab 99%\tab 98%\tab 98%\par \tab \endash 4 or better:\tab 100%\tab 100%\tab 99.8%\par \tab \endash 5 or better:\tab \emdash \tab \emdash \tab 100%\par \par Thus, if your trait is Fair, and the GM says you need a Good result or better to succeed, you need to roll +1 or better. You\rquote ll do this about two times out of five, on the average.\par You\rquote ll notice that using 3d6 or 4d6 the results, while slightly different, are close enough for a game called Fudge. The 4d6 results do allow +/\endash 5, however, but this shouldn\rquote t be a problem since they occur so rarely. In fact, you could use 5dF to allow +/\endash 5 if you wanted\u8230\'c9.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 3.3  Action Modifiers\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 There may be modifiers for any given action, which can affect the odds referred to in the preceding section. Modifiers temporarily improve or reduce a character\rquote s traits.\par Examples: Joe, Good with a sword, is Hurt (\endash 1 to all actions). He is thus only Fair with his sword until he\rquote s healed. Jill has Mediocre Lockpicking skills, but an exceptionally fine set of lock picks gives her a Fair Lockpicking skill while she\rquote s using them.\par If a character has a secondary trait that could contribute significantly to a task, the GM may allow a +1 bonus if the trait is Good or better.\par Example: Verne is at the library, researching an obscure South American Indian ritual. He uses his Research skill of Good, but he also has a Good Anthropology skill. The GM decides this is significant enough to give Verne a Great Research skill for this occasion. If his Anthropology skill were Superb, the GM could simply let Verne use that instead of Research: you don\rquote t get to be Superb in Anthropology without having done a lot of research.\par Other conditions may grant a +/\endash 1 to any trait.

If no Skill seems relevant, choose the most appropriate Attribute. If there is a relevant Skill, but the character is untrained in it (it\rquote s not listed on his character sheet), then use the default: usually Poor. If a high attribute could logically help an untrained skill, set the default at Mediocre. For example, a character wishes to palm some coins without being observed. The GM says to use Sleight of Hand skill, but the character is untrained in Sleight of Hand. The player points out that the character\rquote s Dexterity attribute is Superb, so the GM allows a default of Mediocre Sleight of Hand for this attempt.\par The player then rolls against the character\rquote s trait level, and tries to match or surpass the Difficulty Level set by the GM. In cases where there are degrees of success, the better the roll, the better the character did; the worse the roll, the worse the character did.\par In setting the Difficulty Level of a task, the GM should remember that Poor is the default for most skills. The average trained climber can climb a Fair cliff most of the time, but the average untrained climber will usually get a Poor result. In the example in Section 3.2 (Nathaniel shooting at an archery target), if the target is large and close, even a Mediocre archer could be expected to hit it: Mediocre Difficulty Level. If it were much smaller and farther away, perhaps only a Great archer could expect to hit it regularly: Great Difficulty Level. And so on.\par Example of setting Difficulty Level: Two PCs (Mickey and Arnold) and an NPC guide (Parri) come to a cliff the guide tells them they have to climb. The GM announces this is a difficult, but not impossible, cliff: a Good Difficulty Level roll is required to scale it with no delays or complications. Checking the character sheets, they find that Parri\rquote s Climbing skill is Great and Mickey\rquote s is Good. Arnold\rquote s character sheet doesn\rquote t list Climbing, so his skill level is at default: Poor. Parri and Mickey decide to climb it, then lower a rope for Arnold.\par Parri rolls a +1 result: a rolled degree of Superb. She gets up the cliff without difficulty, and much more quickly than expected. Mickey rolls a \endash 1, however, for a rolled degree of Fair. Since this is one level lower than the Difficulty Level, he\rquote s having problems. Had Mickey done Poorly or even Mediocre, he would perhaps have fallen \emdash  or not even been able to start. Since his rolled degree is only slightly below the Difficulty Level, though, the GM simply rules he is stuck half way up, and can\rquote t figure out how to go on. Parri ties a rope to a tree at the top of the cliff, and lowers it for Mickey. The GM says it is now Difficulty Level: Poor to climb the cliff with the rope in place, and Mickey makes this easily on another roll.\par Arnold would also need a Poor rolled degree to climb the cliff with the rope, but since his skill is Poor, they decide not to risk it. Mickey and Parri have Arnold loop the rope under his arms, and pull him up as he grabs handholds along the way in case they slip. No roll is needed in this case, unless they are suddenly attacked when Arnold is only half way up the cliff\u8230\'c9.\par (The whole situation was merely described as an example of setting Difficulty levels. In actual game play, the GM should describe the cliff, and ask the players how the characters intend to get up it. If they came up with the idea of Parri climbing the cliff and lowering a rope, no rolls would be needed at all \emdash  unless, possibly, time was a critical factor, or there were hidden difficulties the GM chose not to reveal because they couldn\rquote t have been perceived from the bottom of the cliff.)\par Occasionally, the GM will roll in secret for the PC. There are times when even a failed roll would give the player knowledge he wouldn\rquote t otherwise have. These are usually information rolls. For example, if the GM asks the player to make a roll against Perception attribute (or Find Hidden Things skill), and the player fails, the character doesn\rquote t notice anything out of the ordinary. But the player now knows that there is something out of the ordinary that his character didn\rquote t notice\u8230\'c9. Far better for the GM to make the roll in secret, and only mention it on a successful result.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 3.5  Opposed Actions\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 To resolve an Opposed action between two characters, each side rolls dice (4dF, d%, 3d6, 4d6, or whatever is your chosen dice technique) against the appropriate trait and announces the result. The traits rolled against are not necessarily the same: for example, a seduction attempt would be rolled against a Seduction skill for the active participant (or possibly Appearance attribute) and against Will for the resisting participant. There may be modifiers: someone with a vow of chastity might get a bonus of +2 to his Will, while someone with a Lecherous fault would have a penalty \emdash  or not even try to resist.\par The Gamemaster compares the rolled degrees to determine a relative degree. For example, Lisa is trying to flimflam Joe into thinking she\rquote s from the FBI and rolls a Great result. This is not automatic success, however. If Joe also rolls a Great result on his trait to avoid being flimflammed (Knowledge of Police Procedure, Learning, Intelligence, etc. \emdash  whatever the GM decides is appropriate), then the relative degree is 0: the status quo is maintained. In this case, Joe remains unconvinced that Lisa is legitimate. If Joe rolled a Superb result, Lisa\rquote s Great result would have actually earned her a relative degree of \endash 1: Joe is not going to be fooled this encounter, and will probably even have a bad reaction to Lisa.\par The Opposed action mechanism can be used to resolve almost any conflict between two characters. Are two people both grabbing the same item at the same time? This is an Opposed action based on a Dexterity attribute \emdash  the winner gets the item. Is one character trying to shove another one down? Roll Strength vs. Strength (or Wrestling skill) to see who goes down. Someone trying to hide from a search party? Perception attribute (or Find Hidden skill) vs. Hide skill (or Camouflage, Stealth, etc.). Trying to out-drink a rival? Constitution vs. Constitution (or Drinking skill, Carousing, etc.). And so on.\par Some Opposed actions have a minimum level needed for success. For example, an attempt to control a person\rquote s mind with a Telepathy skill might require at least a Fair result. If the telepath only gets a Mediocre result, it doesn\rquote t matter if the intended victim rolls a Poor resistance: the attempt fails. Most combat falls into this category \emdash  see Chapter 4.\par For an example of Opposed actions involving more than two characters, see Section 4.34, Multiple Combatants in Melee.\par An Opposed action can also be handled as an Unopposed action. When a PC is opposing an NPC, have only the player roll, and simply let the NPC\rquote s trait level be the Difficulty Level. This method assumes the NPC will always roll a 0. This emphasizes the PCs\rquote  performance, and reduces the possibility of an NPC\rquote s lucky roll deciding the game.\par As a slight variation on the above, the GM rolls 1dF or 2dF when rolling for an NPC in an opposed action. This allows some variation in the NPC\rquote s ability, but still puts the emphasis on the PCs\rquote  actions.\par For those without Fudge dice, the GM can simply roll 1d6 for an NPC. On a result of 2-5, the NPC gets the listed trait level as a result. On a result of 1, the NPC did worse than her trait level; on a result of 6 the NPC did better than her trait level. Those who want to know precisely how much better or worse should roll a second d6: \par 1,2,3 = +/\endash 1 (as appropriate)\par  4,5  = +/\endash 2\par   6   = +/\endash 3\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 3.6  Critical Results\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Critical results are an optional Fudge rule for GMs who like the idea.

Likewise, a natural result of \endash 4 is a critical failure, and the character has done as poorly as he possibly can in the given situation.\par Note that achieving +/\endash 4 with die modifiers does not count as a critical result, though the character has done exceptionally well or poorly. When a natural critical result is rolled, the GM may ignore what the rolled degree would be, and treat it as an automatic beyond Superb or below Terrible result.\par Optionally, if a character gets a rolled degree four or more levels better than the Difficulty Level, he has gotten a critical success.

When the PCs request information or aid, it might go smoothly or it might not go well at all. Negotiation with a stranger is always an unknown quantity to the players \emdash  it may be so for the GM, too.\par When in doubt, the GM should secretly make a Situational roll.

Examples include Appearance (which could be an attribute, gift or fault), Charisma, Reputation, Status, and such habits as nose-picking or vulgar language. The Reaction roll can also be modified up or down by circumstances: bribes, suspicious or friendly nature of the NPC, proximity of the NPC\rquote s boss, observed PC behavior, etc.\par The higher the Reaction roll result, the better the reaction. On a Fair result, for example, the NPC will be mildly helpful, but only if it\rquote s not too much effort. She won\rquote t be helpful at all on Mediocre or worse results, but will react well on a Good result or better.\par Example: Nathaniel needs some information about the local duke, who he suspects is corrupt.

The GM rolls in secret, and gets a Fair result. The old lady slips out a bit of useful information before realizing what she\rquote s just said.

An individual GM may devise others.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.21  Story Elements\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 In the simplest combat system, the GM explains the situation in as much detail as is apparent, then asks the players to describe what their characters are doing. The more complete the description of their characters\rquote  actions, the better the GM knows how to assess the situation. This can be important if she has something that won\rquote t be revealed until the middle of a battle. Die rolls, if any, are required by the GM for each story element.\par A story element is the smallest unit of time in this type of combat resolution. The GM may break the battle down into several story elements, or treat the whole encounter as one element. This depends on the GM\rquote s style, the importance of the battle, the number of participants, whether or not there are unexpected surprises, etc. Each element should be a dramatic unit.\par For example, the PCs are faced with a detachment of guards at the door while the evil mastermind is trying to activate the Doomsday machine at the back of the room. The fight with the guards might be one element while the confrontation with Dr. Doomsday could be a second. Another GM might treat the whole battle as one story element, while a third GM would treat each 5-second segment separately. Whatever the number of elements, keep the battle description as word-oriented as possible.\par The GM may ask for a single die roll from a player occasionally, or require three rolls and take the median roll.\par (The median is the middle value die roll, which may be the same as either the high or low die roll. For example, if the player rolls a Good, a Mediocre, and a Superb result, the median is Good, since it\rquote s the result in between Mediocre and Superb. But a result of Poor, Great, and Great gives a median die roll of Great. Using a median tends to soften the role of extreme luck. Some GMs use a median when a single die result represents many actions.)\par Once the GM has decided which trait (or traits) each PC should use for this combat, she then gives them a modifier, ranging from \endash 3 to +3. Zero should be the most common modifier. The modifier is based partly on how well the PCs\rquote  plan would work, given what the GM knows of the NPCs, and partly on circumstances: fatigue, lighting, footing, surprise, weapon superiority, bravery or cowardice of NPCs, wounds, etc.\par Here is a long example of story element style of combat:\par Gunner, separated from the other PCs, surprises five members of a rival gang in a garage. The player announces that Gunner will shout and charge the rival mob, carrying his Tommy gun as if he\rquote s about to fire \emdash  they don\rquote t know it\rquote s irreparably jammed. He hopes to see them run away, hit the dirt, or freeze in fear. He\rquote ll then use his Tommy gun as a club, starting at the left end of their line. He\rquote ll keep his current opponent in between him and the others as long as possible. He hopes to then roll up their line, one at a time, keeping the wall to his left side as he charges.\par The GM makes a Situational roll for the mob: Mediocre. The mob members don\rquote t recover quickly from their surprise, so she gives Gunner a +1 to his Brawling skill of Good for this plan. She also decides that one mobster will run away and the others won\rquote t draw their guns until Gunner has already engaged the first enemy. His Running skill is Great, so she gives him another +1, since he can cover ground quickly. Total modifier for Gunner is +2, bringing his Brawling skill to Superb for this combat. Since this is a fairly long action and she doesn\rquote t want a single unlucky roll to ruin Gunner\rquote s chances, she asks him for three Brawling skill rolls (at the +2 modifier), and to use the median roll.\par Gunner rolls a Good, Superb, and Great result, in that order. The median roll is Great, and the GM decides this is good enough to have downed the first two mobsters, and describes the battle so far in entertaining detail. Now Gunner is facing the last two thugs, who finally have their pistols out and could probably plug him before he charges that far. The GM asks, \ldblquote What does Gunner do now?\rdblquote \par Gunner hurls the Tommy gun into the face of one gunman while making a low diving tackle for the other, hoping to dodge under any bullets. The GM calls for a single roll against Brawling to cover this whole action: Gunner gets a Fair result. The GM rules that Gunner throws the Tommy gun well enough to distract one gunman, but not harm him. He does, however, manage to tackle and subdue his other foe, whose shots all go wild.\par At this point, the GM rules that the mobster grazed by the thrown Tommy gun now steps over and points his pistol to Gunner\rquote s head while he\rquote s kneeling over the other mobster. Gunner wisely heeds the call to surrender and hopes his friends can rescue him\u8230\'c9.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.22  Simultaneous Combat Rounds\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Those who like their combat broken down into discrete bits can use combat \ldblquote rounds.\rdblquote  In simultaneous action rounds, all offensive and defensive maneuvers happen at the same time. This is realistic: few real combats consist of fighters taking turns whacking at each other.\par The GM determines which traits the combatants should roll against. This depends largely on which weapon they are using, which might simply be a fist. Weapon type also affects damage \emdash  see Section 4.5, Wounds.\par Each combatant makes an Opposed action roll. On a relative degree of zero, the combat round is a stand-off \emdash  the fighters either circled each other looking for an opening, or exchanged blows on each other\rquote s shields, etc. \emdash  nobody is hurt.\par A minimum result of Poor is needed to hit a (roughly) equal-sized opponent. That is, a human needs to score a Poor blow (and still win the Opposed action) in order to hit another human. If both opponents roll worse than Poor, the round is a standoff.\par If one opponent is significantly bigger than the other (of a different Scale, at least), he needs a Mediocre or even Fair result to hit his smaller foe, while even a Terrible result will allow the small fighter to hit the larger. (Of course, such a blow must still win the Opposed action.) Extremely small targets, such as a pixie, may require a Good or even a Great result. Examples include humans fighting giants, or very large or small animals.\par If the result is a relative degree other than zero, and the minimum level needed to score a hit is achieved or surpassed, the winner checks to see if he hit hard enough to damage the loser. In general, the better the hit (the greater the relative degree), the greater the likelihood of damage.\par If one combatant is unable to fight in a given round (possibly because he\rquote s unaware of the attacker, or because of a critical result in the previous round \emdash  see Section 3.6, Critical Results), the combat may become an Unopposed Action for the active fighter, usually with a Poor Difficulty Level. If a character can defend himself in some way, such as using a shield, it is still an Opposed Action, but the defending character cannot hurt the other character even if he wins the combat round.\par Combat often takes more than one combat round. Characters are not limited to attacking each round \emdash  they may attempt to flee, negotiate, try a fancy acrobatic stunt, or any other appropriate action.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.23  Alternating Combat Turns\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Using alternating combat turns, each combat round consists of two actions: the fighter with the higher initiative attacks while the other defends, then the second combatant attacks while the first defends. With multiple characters involved in combat, the side with the initiative makes all their attacks, then the other side makes all their attacks. Or the GM may run the combat in initiative order, even if fighters from both sides are interspersed throughout the combat turn.\par Gaining initiative is an Opposed action. If the characters don\rquote t have an Initiative attribute or skill \emdash  such as Reflexes or Speed \emdash  simply use Opposed Situational rolls. A gift such as Combat Reflexes can grant a +1 to initiative. Surprise may grant a bonus to the roll, or give automatic initiative. Initiative can be rolled once for each battle or once each round. Perhaps a character could trade skill for initiative: attack hastily (+1 to initiative that round) but be slightly off balance because of it (\endash 1 to attack and defend that round).\par Each attack is an Opposed Action: the attacker\rquote s Offensive skill (Sword, Melee Weapon, Martial Art, etc.) against a defender\rquote s Defensive skill (Shield, Parry, Dodge, Duck, etc.). This type of combat take longer than simultaneous rounds, but some players feel it gives a character more control over his own fate.\par Using these rules, a Defensive parry skill may simply equal the weapon skill, or it may be a separate skill that must be bought independently of an Offensive skill. The GM must tell the players at character creation which method she is using \emdash  or allow them extra levels on the fly to adjust their defensive abilities.\par Some weapons, such as an Axe, are poor parrying weapons. Players should ask the GM at character creation if a weapon may be used to parry and still be used to attack without penalty in the next turn \emdash  and give their characters decent Shield or Dodge skills to compensate for poor parrying weapons.\par All-out offensive and defensive tactics can be used. A character forfeits his attack for a round if he chooses All-out defense, and is at \endash 2 on his defense on his opponent\rquote s next turn if choosing All-out offense \emdash  or perhaps gets no defense at all!\par The default defense for animals depends on their type: carnivores will usually have a Defense value one level less than their Offense, while this is reversed for most prey species.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 4.3  Melee Combat Options\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The various options listed below may be used with any melee system. This is not a comprehensive or \ldblquote official\rdblquote  list of options. The GM should, in fact, consider these options merely as examples to stimulate her imagination. The GM may wish to import complex combat options from other games into Fudge.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.31  Melee Modifiers\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Some situations call for one side or the other\rquote s trait level to be modified. Here are some examples:\par A fighter who is Hurt is at \endash 1, while one who is Very Hurt is at \endash 2.\par If one fighter has a positional advantage over the other, there may be a penalty (\endash 1 or \endash 2) to the fighter in the worse position. Examples include bad footing, lower elevation, light in his eyes, kneeling, etc.\par Subtract the value of a shield from the opponent\rquote s weapon skill. A small shield has a value of +1 in melee combat only, while a medium shield has a value of +1 in melee combat and +1 to defense against ranged attacks (if the shield material is impervious to the weapon). A large shield (+2 in all combat) is cumbersome to lug around. The larger the shield carried, the more the GM should assess penalties for things such as acrobatic and other fancy maneuvers. Shields can also be used offensively to push an opponent back, for example, or knock someone over.\par Compare combatants\rquote  weapon sizes and shields (see Section 4.54, Sample Wound Factors List). If one fighter\rquote s weapon + shield value is +2 (or more) greater than the other fighter\rquote s weapon + shield value, the fighter with the smaller weapon is at \endash 1 to his combat skill. (Example: one fighter has a Two-handed sword: +4 to damage. His opponent has a knife and an average shield: +1 to damage, +1 for shield makes a total of +2. The knife wielder is at \endash 1 to skill in this combat since his weapon modifier is \endash 2 less than the sword fighter\rquote s.)\par Aiming at a specific small body part (such as an eye or hand) will require a minimum result of Good or Great to hit and also have a \endash 1 to the trait level. If a result of Great is needed and the fighter only gets a Good result but still wins the Opposed action, he hits the other fighter \emdash  but not in the part aimed for.\par A fighter may have a magical blessing (+1 or more) or curse (\endash 1 or worse).\par All-out offense, such as a berserk attack, grants a +1 to the combat skill (and an additional +1 for damage, if successful). However, if an all-out attacker ties or loses the Opposed action, the other fighter wins, and gets +2 to damage!\par An All-out defensive stance earns a +2 to the combat skill, but such a combatant cannot harm his foe except with a critical result.\par A successful All-out Defense and a successful Perception or Tactics roll produces a \endash 1 penalty to the opponent on the next round. The fighter takes a few seconds to scope out the area and maneuvers to take advantage of any terrain or conditional irregularity. Similar combat subtleties are possible, and encouraged \emdash  taking a successful All-out defense one round can allow a player to try an acrobatics maneuver the next combat round without risk of being hit, for example.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.32  Offensive/Defensive Tactics\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 This optional rule, used with simultaneous combat rounds, allows more tactical flavor to combat at a small expense of complexity. This option replaces the All-out attack and defense options listed above, and allows for both combatants to be injured in the same combat round.\par Before each round, a fighter may choose to be in a normal posture, an offensive posture or defensive posture. An offensive or defensive stance increases combat skill in one aspect of combat (offense or defense), and decreases the same skill by an equal amount for the other aspect of combat.\par There are five basic options:\par +2 to Offense, \endash 2 to Defense\par +1 to Offense, \endash 1 to Defense\par Normal Offense and Defense\par \endash 1 to Offense, +1 to Defense\par \endash 2 to Offense, +2 to Defense\par Each combat round, a player secretly chooses a combat stance by selecting two Fudge dice and setting them to a result from +2 to \endash 2, which represents an offensive modifier. (The defensive modifier shown above with the offensive modifier is automatically included.) Both sides simultaneously reveal their choices.\par For those without Fudge dice, choose one die placed as follows:\par \tab Die face:\tab Option:\par \tab 1\tab \endash 2 to offense\par \tab 2\tab \endash 1 to offense\par \tab 3,4\tab Normal offense\par \tab 5\tab +1 to offense\par \tab 6\tab +2 to offense\par Each fighter then makes a single Opposed action roll as normal. The result is applied to both offense and defense, however, and will thus have different results for offense and defense if anything other than a normal posture is chosen. The offensive rolled result of each fighter is then compared to the defense of the other fighter.\par For example, a fighter with Good sword skill chooses +1 to offense and \endash 1 to defense for a particular combat round: his offensive sword skill is Great this round, while his defensive sword skill is Fair. His opponent, a Great swordswoman, chooses normal posture. The swordswoman rolls a \endash 1: a Good result for both her offense and defense. The first fighter rolls a 0 result: his offensive rolled result is Great, his defense is Fair.\par His offense result of Great is compared with her Good defense: he wins by +1. However, her offense result of Good is simultaneously compared with his defense of Fair: she also wins the Opposed action by +1. Both sides check for damage, to see if they got through each other\rquote s armor \emdash  see Section 4.5, Wounds.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.33  PCs vs. NPCs\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 If a PC is fighting an NPC the GM can treat combat as an Unopposed action by assuming the NPC will always get a result equal to her trait level. In this case, the PC will have to tie the NPC\rquote s trait level to have a stand-off round, and beat the NPC\rquote s trait in order to inflict damage. This option stresses the player characters\rquote  abilities by disallowing fluke rolls by NPCs.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.34  Multiple Combatants in Melee\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 When more than one opponent attacks a single fighter, they have, at least, a positional advantage. To reflect this, the lone fighter is at \endash 1 to his skill for each additional foe beyond the first. (For epic-style games, with a few heroes battling hordes of enemies, this penalty can be reduced, or the GM can simply give the hordes Poor skills and low Damage Capacity \emdash  which is not out of character for a horde.)\par The lone fighter rolls once, and the result is compared with each of the opponents\rquote  rolled degrees, one after the other. The solo combatant has to defeat or tie all of the opponents in order to inflict a wound on one of them. If he beats all of his foes, he may hit the foe of his choice. If he ties his best opponent, he can only wound another whose result is at least two levels below his.\par Example: Paco is facing three thugs, who have just rolled a Great, Good, and Mediocre result, respectively. Paco rolls a Great result, tying the best thug. He hits the thug who scored a Mediocre result (at least two levels below his result) and is not hit himself (he tied the best thug).\par The lone fighter takes multiple wounds in a single round if two or more enemies hit him. Usually, he can inflict damage on only one foe in any given round \emdash  his choice of those he bested. It\rquote s also possible to allow a sweeping blow to damage more than one foe at a time. Of course, this slows a slash down: reduce damage done by 1 or 2 for each foe cut through.\par A well-armored fighter facing weak opponents can simply concentrate on one foe and let the others try to get through his armor (that is, not defend himself at all against some of his attackers). In this case, the lone fighter can damage his chosen foe even if he is hit by other, ignored foes. This is historically accurate for knights wading through peasant levies, for example. There may or may not be a penalty for the lone fighter in this case.\par There\rquote s a limit to the number of foes that can simultaneously attack a single opponent. Six is about the maximum under ideal conditions (such as wolves, or spear-wielders), while only three or four can attack if using weapons or martial arts that require a lot of maneuvering space. If the lone fighter is in a doorway, only one or two fighters can reach him.\par When multiple NPCs beset a lone PC, the GM may wish to use the option in Section 4.33, PCs vs. NPCs. This will save a lot of die rolling.\par Alternately, she may wish to roll only once for all the NPCs. The lone fighter is still at \endash 1 per extra opponent. The GM rolls 2dF, and applies the result to each NPC. For example, if the GM gets a +1 result, each attacker scores a +1.\par For those without Fudge dice, the GM could simply use the 1d6 method discussed in Section 3.5, Opposed Actions.\par Example: Three NPC pirates, complete with eye-patches, scars, earrings, sneers and generally bad attitudes, are attacking dashing PC hero Tucker. The pirates (whose names are Molly, Annie, and Maggie) are Fair, Good, and Mediocre, respectively, at combat skills. Tucker is a Superb swordsman, but is at \endash 2 for having two extra fighters attacking him at once: his skill is Good for this combat. The GM wants to roll just once (applying the result to all three pirates) rather than rolling three times each combat round.\par Rolling 2dF, she gets a +1 on the first round. The pirates have just gotten Good, Great, and Fair results, respectively. If Tucker scores a Superb result, he could hit the pirate of his choice and remain unhit. On a Great result, Tucker would be unhit, and could land a blow on Maggie. On a Good result, he doesn\rquote t hit anyone, but Annie hits him. If Tucker rolls a Fair result, both Molly and Annie would hit him. The process is repeated each round.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.35  Hit Location\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 A light blow to an eye is very different from a light blow to an armored shoulder, or to a shield. Using a hit location system adds flavor to combat and the description of a character\rquote s equipment, wounds \emdash  and scars! Many games have a hit location system, and a GM can easily translate one she is familiar with to Fudge. Or she can use the simple system given here.\par The simplest system is not to worry about \ldblquote called shots.\rdblquote  Merely say the better the relative degree, the better the location of the blow. Winning a battle by +8 will allow the attacker to pierce an eye, if desired. Hopefully, the players will describe their actions in such detail that the GM will know how close they came to their objective merely by looking at the relative degree.\par A more complicated system: an attacker can announce that he is aiming at a specific body location \emdash  this must be done before rolling to hit. The GM decides the minimum relative degree necessary for such a shot to succeed, usually ranging from 2 to 4, though extreme locations (such as an eyeball) are harder to hit. So if a player wishes his character to hit his opponent\rquote s weapon arm, the GM can respond, \ldblquote You have to win by 2 to do so.\rdblquote  If the player then does win by relative degree 2 or more, the weapon arm is hit, and the wound is specific to that arm.\par If the attacker wins the combat round, but not by the minimum relative degree needed to hit the called target, the defender names which part of the body \emdash  or shield! \emdash  is hit. This will most likely be general body (if there is no shield), but it could be the off-hand, which would carry a lesser combat penalty than a wound to the torso. The GM may have to fudge some here.\par A damaged specific body part can be described as being Scratched (no real game effect), Hurt (a penalty to use, but the body part still functions), and Incapacitated. After battle is the time to decide if an Incapacitated body part can be healed, or is permanently Incapacitated.\par A Hurt body part is generally at \endash 1 to its normal use. A Hurt sword arm gives a \endash 1 penalty to combat, for example, while a Hurt leg is \endash 1 to any running, acrobatics, etc. A Hurt eye is \endash 1 to vision, and so on.\par To determine the exact level of the damage, the GM should consider how well the hit scored, as well as the Strength of the attacker and the weapon being used. Winning by the minimum relative degree necessary to hit the specific body part shouldn\rquote t make the victim Incapacitated unless the attacker is of a much larger Scale than the defender. On the other hand, an arm hit with a battle axe wielded by a large, berserk Viking has a good chance of being cut off even if the Viking just rolled exactly what he needed to hit the arm\u8230\'c9.\par As a guideline, if the attacker surpasses the relative degree necessary to hit the body part at all, the part is Scratched or Hurt, depending on Strength and weapon deadliness. If he surpasses it significantly, the part is Hurt or Incapacitated.\par Species other than humans may have a different list of body parts to hit, and/or different difficulty modifiers.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.36  Fancy Stuff\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 A lot of fancy maneuvers are possible in Fudge combat. All require a bit of thought on the GM\rquote s part.\par What if you want a Speed or Reflexes trait to affect how often you can strike in combat? How would you handle someone of Good Speed vs. someone of Fair Speed?\par If someone has a Power that speeds him up beyond the human norm, you can simply have him attack every other round as if his opponent wasn\rquote t aware of the attack. That is, every other round, an Unopposed result of Poor or better hits the foe, with no chance to be hit back in return.\par For more subtle differences, the GM may allow an Opposed action to determine if one fighter gets to land a blow first: after declaring their actions, each fighter makes a roll against a Speed trait. The winner of the Opposed action, if any, adds the difference to his weapon skill.\par How about Fudge\rquote s \ldblquote graininess\rdblquote  getting in the way of interesting combat? That is, since there are only seven levels in Fudge, a Good fighter will often meet another Good fighter, and it doesn\rquote t seem right that you can\rquote t meet someone who\rquote s just a little better or worse than you.\par In this case, the GM can create new levels of combat skills (there\rquote s no point in using this option with other skills). These new levels require full experience points to reach, but function only as \ldblquote half\rdblquote  levels, called \ldblquote plus\rdblquote  levels. Thus, you can have:\par Superb +\par Superb\par Great +\par Great\par Good +\par Good\par And so on. In any combat, someone with a \ldblquote +\rdblquote  has the skill level listed before the \ldblquote +\rdblquote , but gets a +1 every other round, starting with the second round. So in a combat between Gus (skill Great) and Ivan (skill Good +), Gus would have the higher skill on on rounds one, three, five, etc. But on rounds two, four, six, etc., Ivan will roll as if he had a Great skill, thus being Gus\rquote s equal those rounds.\par What about swinging on chandeliers and other swashbuckling moves? Since role-playing games have more to do with movies than real life, this should be encouraged if the genre is at all cinematic.\par In these cases, have the player describe his swashbuckling intentions as fully and dramatically as he can. The better the story, the better the bonus to the die roll \emdash  or no roll needed if the outcome is entertaining enough. You may then request a roll against Dexterity, or Acrobatics (or even Chutzpah!) and let that determine how well he accomplished his aim. Maybe the swing on the chandelier came off great, but the landing on the banister was a little rough, so the slide down to slam the villain in the back was a tad off, and instead of knocking him out, you merely made him drop his weapon, but then fell on the floor yourself, and now he\rquote s mad, and maybe you should get up before he picks up his pistol, or you could try to yank the carpet while you\rquote re down there, right next to it, and he seems to standing on it a bit off-balance\u8230\'c9 Whatever is fun!\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 4.4  Ranged Combat\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Ranged combat may or may not be an Opposed action.\par If the target is unaware of the assault, the attacker makes an Unopposed action roll to see if he hits his target. The GM sets the Difficulty Level based on distance, lighting, cover, etc. Do not modify the attacker\rquote s skill for range, partial cover, or other circumstances \emdash  that\rquote s included in the Difficulty Level. Equipment such as a laser sighting scope can modify the attacker\rquote s skill, though.\par If the defender is aware of the attack it is an Opposed action: the attacker\rquote s ranged weapon skill against the defender\rquote s defensive trait. (A Difficulty Level for range, lighting, etc., is still set by the GM, and is the minimum rolled degree needed to hit.) A defensive roll should be made against a Dodge skill, or Agility attribute, or something similar.\par If the ranged weapon is thrown, there is no modifier to the defense roll. However, a propelled weapon, such as a bow, gun, or beam weapon, is much harder to avoid. In this case, reduce the defender\rquote s trait by \endash 2 or \endash 3. Obviously, the defender isn\rquote t trying to dodge a bullet, but dodging the presumed path of a bullet when an attacker points a gun at him.\par Of course, the defender may decline to dodge, but shoot back instead. In this case, the action is Unopposed \emdash  making the Difficulty Level is all that is needed to hit. The GM may make such actions simultaneous.\par Example: Nevada Slim and the El Paso Hombre are facing off in a showdown. Both are in the open, in the sunlight, so there\rquote s no lighting or cover difficulty. The range is obviously the same for both \emdash  the GM rules it\rquote s a Fair task to hit each other. Slim rolls a Poor result, and the Hombre a Mediocre result. The Hombre\rquote s bullet came closer to Nevada Slim than vice versa, but both missed since neither made the Difficulty Level.\par Another Example: Will Scarlet is shooting a longbow from the greenwood at Dicken, the Sheriff\rquote s man, who has a crossbow. Dicken knows Will is there, because the man next to him just keeled over with an arrow through his chest. Dicken is in the open, in good light, so only range is of any concern to Will Scarlet: the GM says even a Mediocre shot will hit since they are fairly close. The range for Dicken to hit Will is of course the same, but Will is partially hidden behind a log (cover), and just inside the foliage, so the lighting makes it hard to see him clearly. The GM decrees Dicken needs a Good roll to hit Will. Dicken rolls a Fair result, missing Will. Will rolls a Mediocre result, which hits Dicken, even though it wasn\rquote t as good a shot as Dicken\rquote s.\par In both examples, the fighters forfeited their Dodges in order to shoot simultaneously. Each combatant needed to make the appropriate Difficulty Level to hit. Under these conditions, it\rquote s possible for both combatants to succeed in the same combat round. Had Dicken\rquote s shot hit, Will and Dicken would have skewered each other.\par Guns and similar weapons that do not rely on muscle power should be rated for damage at the beginning of the game. No detailed list is provided, but as a rough guideline: The average small hand gun might be of +2 to +3 Strength, while a derringer might be +1 or even +0. Powerful two-handed projectile weapons are at +5 and higher, while bazookas and other anti-tank weapons are at +10 and higher. Science fiction small weapons may do as much damage as a modern bazooka \emdash  but some are designed to capture people without injuring them.\par Automatic weapons can be simulated roughly by allowing more bullets to hit with higher relative degrees. That is, blasting away with a weapon that fires 20 bullets in a combat round and hitting with relative degree +1 \emdash  a graze \emdash  means only one or two hit the target. If a relative degree +8 represents maximum amount of ammunition on target (whatever that may be for a given weapon), then hitting with a +4 means about half maximum hit the target, while +2 means only one quarter.\par If there is no effective armor, simply add a big damage number if lots of bullets hit: this is going to Incapacitate anyone, at the very least. If armor is at all likely to slow down a bullet, you can\rquote t just add a bigger and bigger damage number if more bullets hit: the armor has a chance to slow down each bullet. In this case, rather than roll damage for each bullet, or have them all stopped, the GM needs to fudge some medium result: give a slight damage bonus if more projectiles hit the target.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 4.5  Wounds\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Fudge offers various methods of tracking wounds, with many options.

Others want as much accuracy as they can get. Fudge presents a simple freeform system that works, and suggests some options to make it more mechanical, and encourages each GM to add as much detail as she is happy with.\par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.51  Wound Levels\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Combat damage to a character can be described as being at one of seven stages of severity. The stages are:\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Undamaged:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  no wounds at all. The character is not necessarily healthy \emdash  he may be sick, for example. But he doesn\rquote t have a combat wound that\rquote s recent enough to be bothering him.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Just A Scratch:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  no real game effect, except to create tension. This may eventually lead to being Hurt if the character is hit again. This term comes from the famous movie line, \ldblquote I\rquote m okay, it\rquote s only a scratch.\rdblquote  The actual wound itself may be a graze, bruise, cut, abrasion, etc., and the GM whose game is more serious in tone may choose to use one of these terms instead.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Hurt: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 the character is wounded significantly, enough to slow him down: \endash 1 to all traits which would logically be affected. A Hurt result in combat can also be called a Light Wound.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Very Hurt: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 the character is seriously hurt, possibly stumbling: \endash 2 to all traits which would logically be affected. A Very Hurt result can also be called a Severe Wound.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Incapacitated:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  the character is so badly wounded as to be incapable of any actions, except possibly dragging himself a few feet every now and then or gasping out an important message. A lenient GM can allow an Incapacitated character to perform such elaborate actions as opening a door or grabbing a gem\u8230\'c9.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Near Death:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  the character is not only unconscious, he\rquote ll die in less than an hour \emdash  maybe a lot less \emdash  without medical help. No one recovers from Near Death on their own unless very lucky.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Dead:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  he has no more use for his possessions, unless he belongs to a culture that believes he\rquote ll need them in the afterlife\u8230\'c9.\par The GM may expand or contract these stages. For example, expand Hurt and Very Hurt to Light Wound, Moderate Wound and Severe Wound. In this case, a Severe Wound might be \endash 3 to all actions \emdash  or the GM might leave it at \endash 2, make Moderate Wound = \endash 1, and make Light Wound something in between a Scratch and Moderate Wound. That is, maybe a Light Wound causes no penalty during combat (you don\rquote t notice such a slight wound in the heat of battle), but after combat the character will be at \endash 1 to all skills until it\rquote s healed (such wounds can be annoying later).\par The GM may allow a high Difficulty Level Willpower roll to reduce or even nullify penalties listed at Hurt, Very Hurt, and possibly Incapacitated. A gift of a High Pain Threshold will reduce the penalties by one level, while a fault of a Low Pain Threshold will increase penalties by one.\par Some players delight in describing their characters\rquote  wounds in detail, even writing resulting scars into the character story.\par Automatic Death: sometimes you don\rquote t have to roll the dice. Holding a knife to a helpless character\rquote s throat is a good example \emdash  no roll needed to kill such a character, but the killer\rquote s karma suffers.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.52  Damage Capacity\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 In Fudge, Damage Capacity determines how wounds affect a character. Damage Capacity may be called Hit Points, if desired. It may be tied to a character trait such as Constitution (or Hardiness, Fitness, Health, Body, Strength, etc.), or it may be a separate trait \emdash  see Section 6.3, Character Examples. It can also be treated as a gift/fault.\par The GM decides how to handle the differing abilities of humans to take damage. It really does vary, but how much is open to debate.\par As an extreme example, take the death of the Russian monk Rasputin, the adviser to Czarina Alexandra, in 1916. He was fed enough cyanide to kill three normal people, but showed no signs of it. He was then shot in the chest and pronounced dead by a physician. A minute later he opened his eyes and attacked his assassins! They shot him twice more, including in the head, and beat him severely with a knuckle-duster. He was again pronounced dead, tied in curtains and ropes, and tossed into a river. When his body was retrieved three days later, it was found he had freed an arm from his bindings before finally dying of drowning! Clearly, the man could soak up damage well beyond most peoples\rquote  abilities. He is not unique, however: there are many cases in history of people being hard to kill.\par On the other hand, the phrase \ldblquote glass jaw\rdblquote  is familiar to most English speakers, referring to those who are hurt from the slightest blow.\par So there is undoubtedly some room for variation in damage capacity in characters.\par If the GM is handling wounds in a freeform matter, make Damage Capacity an attribute and let players rate their characters in it like any other attribute. Or have a gift (Damage Resistant, perhaps) and a fault (Fragile, maybe), and let everyone without either the gift or the fault be normal in this regard. The GM can assess the character\rquote s ability to take damage based on that information and the situation at hand.\par If the GM wants a more numerical approach to wound determination, it requires some forethought. If Damage Capacity is an attribute, the easiest way to rate it numerically in Fudge is the standard:\par +3 for Superb Damage Capacity\par +2 for Great Damage Capacity\par +1 for Good Damage Capacity\par +0 for Fair Damage Capacity\par \endash 1 for Mediocre Damage Capacity\par \endash 2 for Poor Damage Capacity\par \endash 3 for Terrible Damage Capacity\par However, since light metal armor, as listed in Section 4.54, Sample Wound Factors List, only grants a +2 to defense against being wounded, it is easily seen that a Great Damage Capacity is equal to light metal armor. Some GMs will find this absurd: a naked person of Great Damage Capacity can turn a sword as well as an armored person of Fair Damage Capacity. Others will remember Rasputin, and consider it within the bounds of reason \emdash  it could be part body size (vital organs harder to reach) and part healthiness (muscle tissue more resistant to being cut).\par For simplicity, any equation-driven approach to wounds in Fudge assumes the GM will use a Damage Capacity attribute, and it is rated from +3 to \endash 3, as listed above. If you are not happy with this, please make the necessary mental substitution.\par Here are some other possible ways to handle Damage Capacity numerically:\par 1) Make Damage Capacity an attribute, as above, but instead of automatically granting a bonus, require a Damage Capacity die roll every time a character is hit for at least a Light Wound (Hurt result). On a result of:\par Great or better: reduce the severity of the wound by one.\par Mediocre to Good: no adjustment to the severity of the wound.\par Poor or worse: increase the severity of the wound by one.\par This adjustment can either be one wound level, or simply one damage point, as the GM sees fit.\par For certain types of damage \emdash  perhaps from a stun ray or a quarterstaff across the ribs \emdash  the GM can use the values from +3 to \endash 3 without requiring a roll.\par 2) Do not use a Damage Capacity attribute; instead allow the players to take a gift of Damage Resistant (reduces wound severity by one) or a fault of Fragile (increases wound severity by one). Again, this adjustment can be one wound level, or one damage point.\par 3) Use a Damage Capacity attribute, as outlined as the first suggestion under Section 4.57, Recording Wounds. Each hit temporarily reduces your Damage Capacity attribute one or more levels.\par 4) Use a Willpower attribute instead of Damage Capacity. GMs who believe that Rasputin was able to overcome so much damage because his will was focused on overcoming his enemies may use this method. Grant an adjustment to the wound level based on the result of a Willpower die roll. This can be temporary \emdash  until the battle is over \emdash  or actually have a permanent affect on reducing wound severity.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.53  Wound Factors\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 When determining how wounded a character is when hit in combat, take into consideration all of the following factors:\par 1) The relative degree the attack succeeded by \emdash  the better the hit, the greater likelihood of damage. Winning a combat round with a relative degree of +1 means you probably hit where the opponent is most heavily armored. Scoring a hit with a +3 finds a chink in the armor.\par 2) The strength of the blow. For muscle-powered weapons, such as melee weapons, unarmed attacks, bows, slings, etc., this is determined by the attacker\rquote s Strength attribute: stronger folks tend to hit harder. The relative Scale modifier is also figured in here. For things like guns, beam weapons, etc., it is relative to the nature of the weapon: a .38 usually does more damage than a .22. The technological level of the weapon can be important.\par 3) The deadliness of the attacker\rquote s weapon. Big weapons tend to do more damage than little weapons; sharp weapons rip tissue more than dull ones, but blunt weapons can cause concussive damage through armor thick enough to stop a sharp weapon. People trained in Karate tend to do more damage than those untrained in any martial art.\par 4) The defender\rquote s armor. People wearing thicker armor, and more of it, tend to get hurt less than those wearing no armor. Armor can be finely differentiated, or simply said to be Light, Medium, or Heavy armor. Science fiction scenarios will have Extra-Heavy armor, and even further levels. Fantasy campaigns may include magic armor that offers even greater protection, sometimes specific against certain types of damage.\par 5) The amount of damage the victim can soak up (Robustness, Damage Capacity, or Mass). Big, healthy guys can take more damage before collapsing than little, sickly guys. But it\rquote s your call if it\rquote s a big, sickly fighter against a little, healthy fellow.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.54  Sample Wound Factors List\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For those who prefer numerical values, here are some suggested numbers to attach to the factors listed in the previous section. These may be customized to taste, of course, and are only offered as a starting point. If used, they should be written down on the character sheet at character creation (probably with the weapons and armor), so as to be readily available during combat.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Offensive factors:\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For Character\rquote s Strength (muscle-powered weapons only):\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 +3 for Superb Strength\par +2 for Great Strength\par +1 for Good Strength\par +0 for Fair Strength\par \endash 1 for Mediocre Strength\par \endash 2 for Poor Strength\par \endash 3 for Terrible Strength\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For Attacker\rquote s Scale:\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Plus the attacker\rquote s Strength Scale(see Section 4.68, Non-human Scale in Combat).\par Note: the attacker\rquote s Strength Scale is relevant only for muscle-powered weapons and for those projectile weapons scaled to the attacker\rquote s size, such as miniature bazookas or giant-sized handguns. A superhero of Scale 10 using an ordinary pistol would not figure his Scale into the Offensive Damage Modifier.\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For Weapon\rquote s Strength(Guns, Crossbows, Beam weapons, etc.):\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 +/\endash  Strength of weapon(see Section 4.4, Ranged Combat).\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For Muscle-Powered Weapon:\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 \endash 1 for no weapon, not using a Martial Art skill.\par +0 Martial Art skill, or for small weapons(blackjack, knife, brass knuckles,sling, thick boots if kicking, etc.).\par +1 for medium-weight one-handed weapons(billy club, machete, shortsword,epee, hatchet, rock, etc.).\par +2 for large one-handed weapons(broadsword, axe, large club, etc.),or for light two-handed weapons(spear, bow, etc.).\par +3 for most two-handed weapons(polearm, two-handed sword, battleaxe, etc.).\par +1 for sharpness(add to other weapon damageknife becomes +1, shortsword +2,broadsword +3, greatsword +4, etc.).\par Note: For a less lethal game, subtract 1 from each type of weapon except sharpness. (This will lengthen combats.)\par Note: the value of a shield may be subtracted from the opponent\rquote s skill \emdash  see Section 4.31, Melee Modifiers.\par Optional note, as an example of the detail you can achieve in Fudge: for heavy blunt metal weapons, such as maces and flails, halve any protection from the defender\rquote s armor, round down. The concussive damage from such weapons is slowed, but not totally stopped, by most armor. Example: if using a large mace (+2 weapon) against plate armor (+4 armor), the armor only counts as +2 armor.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Defensive factors:\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For Character\rquote s Damage Capacity Attribute:\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Note: this is optional \emdash  see Section 4.52, Damage Capacity, for a complete discussion.\par +3 for Superb Damage Capacity\par +2 for Great Damage Capacity\par +1 for Good Damage Capacity\par +0 for Fair Damage Capacity\par \endash 1 for Mediocre Damage Capacity\par \endash 2 for Poor Damage Capacity\par \endash 3 for Terrible Damage Capacity\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For Armor:\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 +1 for light, pliable non-metal armor.\par +2 for heavy, rigid non-metal armor\par +2 for light metal armor.\par +3 for medium metal armor.\par +4 for heavy metal armor.\par +5 or more for science fiction advanced armor.\par Note: magical armor may add anywhere from +1 to whatever the GM will allow to any given armor type above.\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 For Defender\rquote s Mass Scale:\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Plus the defender\rquote s Mass Scale(see Section 4.58, Non-human Scale in Combat).\par (If the defender has Mass other than Fair, or a gift of Tough Hide, it should also be figured in.)\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.55  Determining Wound Level\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 A given blow will cause a certain level of wounding. In the simplest wound determination system, the GM assesses all of the Wound Factors (Section 4.53) and announces how bad the wound is. (In some cases, however, the PCs won\rquote t know the precise degree of damage. In those cases, the GM can simply say, \ldblquote You think you wounded her, but she\rquote s still on her feet,\rdblquote  or, \ldblquote You don\rquote t notice any effect.\rdblquote )\par As an example, the GM thinks to herself, \ldblquote Okay, the fighter with Good Strength just scored a Great hit with a broadsword. The loser rolled a Fair combat roll, has Good Damage Capacity and heavy leather armor. Hmmm \emdash  I\rquote ll say the Strength and Damage Capacity cancel each other, while the sharp sword should be able to penetrate the leather armor if the blow is good enough. A Great hit against a Fair defense is enough, but not really massive: I\rquote d say the loser is Hurt.\rdblquote  This result would then be announced to the loser of the combat round.\par The GM can also use a Situational roll to help her. Roll the dice behind a GM screen, and let the result guide you. A roll of \endash 1 to +1 isn\rquote t significant \emdash  no change from what you decided. But a roll of +3 or +4 adds a wound level or two to the damage.\par See Section 4.57, Recording Wounds, for details on how to keep track of wounds received.\par That system, while simple and satisfying to a certain type of GM, doesn\rquote t do much for those who prefer the system detailed in Section 4.54, Sample Wound Factors List. There\rquote s no point in figuring out the offensive and defensive factors if you don\rquote t do something with the numbers.\par One system that uses the offensive and defensive factors requires finding the total damage factor. This is derived by adding up all the attacker\rquote s offensive factors and then subtracting all the defender\rquote s factors.\par Example, first Leroy attacking Theodora, then vice versa:\par \par Leroy:\par Good Strength (+1)\par Scale 0\par Broadsword (+2 for size, +1 for sharpness = +3 weapon).\par Offensive damage factors = 1+0+3 = 4\par \par Theodora:\par Fair Damage Capacity (+0)\par Scale 0\par Boiled leather armor (+2)\par Defensive damage factors = 0+0+2 = 2.\par \par Leroy\rquote s total damage factor against Theodora is 4\endash 2 = 2.\par \par Theodora:\par Superb Strength (+3)\par Poleaxe (+4)\par Offensive damage factors = 3+0+4 = 7\par \par Leroy:\par Good Damage Capacity (+1)\par Scale mail armor (+3)\par Defensive damage factors = 1+0+3 = 4.\par Theodora\rquote s total damage factor against Leroy is 7\endash 4 = 3.\par Since Theodora\rquote s damage factor is larger, if she hits him, she\rquote ll do more damage to him than he would to her for an equally well-placed blow.\par Once these numbers are determined, jot them down so you don\rquote t have to refigure them each combat round.\par This system requires each character sheet to have a wound record track which looks like:\par \par \tab \tab 1,2\tab \tab 3,4\tab \tab 5,6\tab \tab 7,8\tab \tab 9+\par Wounds:\tab Scratch\tab \tab Hurt\tab \tab Very Hurt\tab Incapac.\tab \tab Nr. Death\par \par The numbers above the wound levels represent the amount of damage needed in a single blow to inflict the wound listed under the number. For example, a blow of 3 or 4 points Hurts the character, while a blow of 5 or 6 points inflicts a Very Hurt wound.\par These numbers can be customized by the GM to fit her conception of how damage affects people. Raising the numbers makes it harder to wound someone, while lowering them makes combat more deadly.\par Note that there is no number given for Dead. This is left up to the GM, and deliberately not included to prevent accidental PC death.\par However, you can\rquote t simply use the damage factor you determined above \emdash  relative degree is also important.\par A relative degree of +1 is treated as a graze \emdash  see Section 4.56, Grazing.\par Otherwise, simply add the relative degree to the damage factor. (You may also wish to include a damage roll \emdash  see Section 4.61, Damage Die Roll.)\par The result is a number that may or may not be a positive number. If it\rquote s zero or less, no damage is scored.\par If the number is positive, look up the result across the top of the wound levels, and figure the wound as described above. If Leroy hits Theodora with a relative degree of +2, he adds that to his damage potential of +2 to produce a damage number of 4. Looking down, we see that a result of 4 is a Hurt result (Light Wound). Theodora is Hurt, and at \endash 1 until she is healed.\par For more detail, see Section 4.7, Combat and Wounding Example.\par There are other ways to figure damage. A GM who believes the relative degree is more important than the damage factor would double it before adding it to the damage factor. The numbers above the wound levels should be adjusted in this case:\par \par \tab \tab 1-3\tab \tab 4-6\tab \tab 7-9\tab \tab 10-12\tab \tab 13+\par Wounds:\tab Scratch\tab \tab Hurt\tab \tab Very Hurt\tab Incapac.\tab \tab Nr. Death\par \par This is a satisfying system that is recommended for those who don\rquote t mind doubling relative degree.\par Others feel Strength is more important, and so on. A totally different wounding system is given in Section 4.63, Min-Mid-Max Die Roll. Many others have been proposed for Fudge over the years, and it would be easy to import one from another game system. Use what you feel comfortable with.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.56  Grazing\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Any relative degree of +1 can do at most a GM-set Wound level (plus any Scale difference). It may do no damage at all, depending on the opponent\rquote s defensive factors: a fist hitting plate mail won\rquote t hurt the armored knight in the slightest \emdash  unless it\rquote s a giant\rquote s fist.\par Sample graze severity table:\par \tab Damage\par \tab Factor\tab Result\par \tab <0\tab Undamaged\par \tab 0-4\tab Scratch\par \tab  5+\tab Hurt\par \par A GM may or may not allow a damage die roll on a graze, even if using the die rolls for other hits. If allowed, a damage roll shouldn\rquote t change the result of a graze by more than one level.\par Scale difference is a little trickier to figure, but it should be minimized for such a narrow victory: a giant\rquote s club could give a human a glancing blow that might inflict a Very Hurt result, but not necessarily Incapacitate.\par On the other hand, a tiger biting a mouse with a relative degree of +1 grazes the mouse as a cow grazes grass\u8230\'c9.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.57  Recording Wounds\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Once the final damage is determined, it is recorded on the wounded fighter\rquote s character sheet. Each individual wound is described as a Scratch, Hurt (Light Wound), etc., as introduced in Section 4.51, Wound Levels.\par Use a Damage Capacity attribute as an easy way to record wounds. (In this case, Damage Capacity is not figured into determining wound severity.) Each hit that is greater than a Scratch reduces a character\rquote s Damage Capacity attribute one level \emdash  or more, if the GM deems the hit to be severe enough. (Scratches can accumulate as the GM desires \emdash  perhaps three Scratches equal one hit.)\par When someone is reduced to Mediocre Damage Capacity, he is Hurt: \endash 1 to all actions. When he is at Poor Damage Capacity, he is Very Hurt: \endash 2 to all actions. When he drops to Terrible, he is at \endash 3 to all actions \emdash  or Incapacitated, if a GM wishes to play it that way. Damage Capacity below Terrible is Incapacitated, at least \emdash  possibly worse.\par (For characters of Mediocre or worse Damage Capacity, these levels only affect them when damaged. That is, an undamaged character of Mediocre Damage Capacity is not at \endash 1 to all actions. However, if he takes even one hit, he drops to Poor Damage Capacity, and is at \endash 2 to all actions.)\par Healing in such a system cannot raise Damage Capacity above a character\rquote s undamaged level \emdash  that can only be raised through Character Development (see Chapter 5).\par A more detailed method requires a space on the character sheet to record wounds. This would look like:\par \par \tab \tab 1,2\tab \tab 3,4\tab \tab 5,6\tab \tab 7,8\tab \tab 9+\par Wounds:\tab Scratch\tab \tab Hurt\tab \tab Very Hurt\tab Incapac.\tab \tab Nr. Death\par \tab \tab [   ]  [   ]  [   ]\tab [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\par \par The numbers above the wound levels are discussed in Section 4.55, Determining Wound Level.\par The boxes below the wound levels represent how many of each wound type a fighter can take.\par When a wound is received, mark off the appropriate box. A character takes a Very Hurt result in the first round of combat. The character sheet would then look like:\par \par \tab \tab 1,2\tab \tab 3,4\tab \tab 5,6\tab \tab 7,8\tab \tab 9+\par Wounds:\tab Scratch\tab \tab Hurt\tab \tab Very Hurt\tab Incapac.\tab \tab Nr. Death\par \tab \tab [   ]  [   ]  [   ]\tab [   ]\tab \tab [X]\tab \tab [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\par \par This character is at \endash 2 to all skills since he\rquote s Very Hurt.\par If he then received a Hurt result, he would check it off like so:\par \par \tab \tab 1,2\tab \tab 3,4\tab \tab 5,6\tab \tab 7,8\tab \tab 9+\par Wounds:\tab Scratch\tab \tab Hurt\tab \tab Very Hurt\tab Incapac.\tab \tab Nr. Death\par \tab \tab [   ]  [   ]  [   ]\tab [X]\tab \tab [X]\tab \tab [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\par \par This character is still at \endash 2 to all skills. The Hurt result is not cumulative with the Very Hurt result; only the penalty for the highest recorded wound level counts.\par If there is no open box for a given wound result, the character takes the next highest wound for which there is an open box. If the character above, for example, takes another Hurt result, we see that there is no open box in either Hurt or Very Hurt, so we have to go to Incapacitated: the character is now incapacitated, and the sheet would look like:\par \par \tab \tab 1,2\tab \tab 3,4\tab \tab 5,6\tab \tab 7,8\tab \tab 9+\par Wounds:\tab Scratch\tab \tab Hurt\tab \tab Very Hurt\tab Incapac.\tab \tab Nr. Death\par \tab \tab [   ]  [   ]  [   ]\tab [X]\tab \tab [X]\tab \tab [H]\tab \tab [   ]\par \par Note that an \ldblquote H\rdblquote  is recorded under the Incapacitated label. The character is indeed Incapacitated \emdash  he can\rquote t fight any more \emdash  but for healing (and scarring) purposes, he has only received two Hurt wounds and one Very Hurt wound \emdash  never an Incapacitating wound in one blow. Since Incapacitating blows are harder to heal from, this is important.\par As another example, a character that takes two Very Hurt results without taking any other hits is Incapacitated, since that is the next highest wound level.\par Note that three boxes are provided under Scratch. This can be customized by each GM, of course. A Scratch wound will not make a fighter Hurt until he receives his fourth Scratch. Optionally, a Scratch will never raise a character\rquote s wound level beyond Very Hurt, no matter how many he takes. The GM should not to use this rule when the PCs fight a monster of huge Scale. Otherwise, they\rquote d never be able to kill such a creature when the worst wound they can inflict is a Scratch.\par The wound progression above makes for a fairly realistic campaign. For a more cinematic campaign (especially those without magic or science fiction healing), add an extra box for Scratch, Hurt, and possibly Very Hurt: lesser blows won\rquote t accumulate so quickly to hinder the character. A moderately cinematic character sheet looks like:\par \par \tab \tab 1,2\tab \tab 3,4\tab \tab 5,6\tab \tab 7,8\tab \tab 9+\par Wounds:\tab Scratch\tab \tab Hurt\tab \tab Very Hurt\tab Incapac.\tab \tab Nr. Death\par \tab \tab [   ]  [   ]  [   ]\tab [   ]  [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\par \par It wouldn\rquote t be out of line, for an epic scale game, to add up to two more boxes to Hurt and Very Hurt.\par Be warned that adding boxes can lengthen combat significantly.\par Never add boxes for cannon-fodder NPCs, though you may wish to do so for major NPCs. In fact, NPC pawns don\rquote t even need the system above. A simple three-stage system of Undamaged, Hurt, Out of the Battle is good enough for most of them. Simply make a mark under an NPC\rquote s name for Hurt, and cross out the name for Out of the Battle.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.58  Non-human Scale in Combat\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The attacker\rquote s Strength Scale is added to his offensive damage factors, and the defender\rquote s Mass Scale is added to her defensive damage factors. If you have combat with beings weaker than humans, remember what you learned in school about adding and subtracting negative numbers\u8230\'c9.\par Armor and weapons affect the damage done normally, since they are scaled to the folks using them. Hits become Scratches, Hurt, etc., as usual \endash  see Section 4.55, Determining Wound Level.\par However, an extremely small character is not likely to be able to wound a large one in the numerical value wounding system. The GM may allow a point or two of damage to penetrate if the small character gets a critical success. Poison-tipped arrows and lances are also a possibility: the small character can aim for joints in the armor and merely has to break the skin to inject the poison.\par Also, this system treats Mass Scale like armor, which isn\rquote t quite accurate. In reality, a small opponent may be slowly carving the larger fighter up, but each wound is too petty, relative to the large scale, to do much damage by itself. To reflect a lot of small wounds gradually inflicting a hit on a large-scale foe, allow a damage roll when Scale prevents a hit from doing any damage \endash  that is, when Scale is the only difference between getting a Scratch and no damage at all. See Section 4.61, Damage Die Roll.\par There are also \ldblquote scale piercing\rdblquote  weapons, such as whale harpoons and elephant guns. These don\rquote t have massive damage numbers: instead, if they hit well, simply halve the Scale value, or ignore it all together. Of course, if such a weapon is used on a human, it would indeed have a massive damage modifier\u8230\'c9.\par Combat Examples: In the following examples, each fighter\rquote s Strength Scale equals his own Mass Scale, but not his opponent\rquote s. (E.g., Wilbur\rquote s Strength is Scale 0 and his Mass is Scale 0.) Also, it is assumed the GM is not using the optional damage roll, which could vary damage in all three combats discussed.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 First example:\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Sheba, a human warrior, has just kicked McMurtree, a wee leprechaun.

Since there are three Scratch boxes for a major NPC, Wilbur will have to do this thrice more before he finally Hurts the dragon.

Many others are possible in Fudge, and this list should not be considered official or exhaustive. They are included for possible use, but also to inspire the GM to create her own.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.61  Damage Die Roll\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Although the damage roll is optional, it is recommended if you are using numerical damage factors. This is because the damage factors are generally fixed for the entire fight, and things tend to get stagnant. It also allows a tiny fighter to have a chance against a larger foe \emdash  a satisfying result.\par There are many possible ways to use a damage die roll.\par One could roll a single Fudge die for a result of \endash 1, 0, or +1. This can be added to the damage factor, or, more broadly, to the actual wound level.\par For example, if a fighter inflicts 4 points of damage, that is normally a Hurt result. If a +1 on 1dF is rolled, however, that can make the result +5 (if adding to the damage factor), which brings it up to Very Hurt result. However, a \endash 1 wouldn\rquote t change the wound: it would lower the result to 3, which is still a Hurt result. But if the GM is using 1dF to alter the wound level, then a \endash 1 changes the result to a Scratch, since that\rquote s one wound level below Hurt.\par Instead of a separate damage roll, one could simply use the die rolls used to resolve the Opposed action. If the attacker wins with an even roll (\endash 4, \endash 2, 0, +2, +4), add one to his offensive factor. If he wins with an odd result (\endash 3, \endash 1, +1, +3), his offensive factor is unchanged. Do the same for the defender, except it affects his defensive factor. This system will help the defender 25% of the time, the attacker 25% of the time, and won\rquote t affect the damage results at all 50% of the time.\par Example: the defender loses the combat round, but rolls his trait level exactly (die roll of 0): he adds one to his defensive damage factor. The attacker wins with a die roll of +3: his offensive damage factor is unchanged. The final damage number is reduced by one \emdash  the defender, although losing the round, managed to dodge left as the attacker thrust a bit to the right, perhaps. He may still be wounded, but he got his vital organs out of the way of the blow.\par This system could also be applied to the wound level instead of the damage factor.\par A more complicated system uses a Situational roll (result from \endash 4 to +4, not based on any trait), and adds it to the calculated damage number (the number over the wound level), as found in Section 4.55, Determining Wound Level. Negative final damage is treated as zero damage.\par The GM may wish to apply some limitations to the damage roll, to restrict too wild a result. For example:\par 1) If the calculated damage is positive, the damage roll cannot exceed the calculated damage. That is, if the calculated damage is +2, any damage roll of +3 or +4 is treated as +2, for a total of 4 points of damage.\par 2) If the calculated damage is positive, the final damage cannot be less than +1.\par 3) If the calculated damage is negative or zero, the final damage may be raised to a maximum of +1 by a damage roll.\par First Example: The calculated damage is found to be \endash 2 due to armor and Scale. It would take a +3 or +4 die roll to inflict a wound on the defender in this case, and then only 1 point of calculated damage: a Scratch.\par Second Example: The calculated damage is +2 (a Scratch). A damage roll of +2 to +4 results in final damage of four points, since calculated damage cannot be more than doubled by a damage roll. A damage roll of +1 results in final damage of three points, while a damage roll of 0 results in two points of final damage. Any negative die roll results in one point of final damage, since a positive calculated damage cannot be reduced below one by a damage roll.\par For simplicity, of course, the GM can simply ignore the limitations, and allow the damage roll to be anywhere from \endash 4 to +4, let the chips fall where they may\u8230\'c9.\par Many other damage die rolls are possible \emdash  these are only given as examples to the GM.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.62  Stun, Knockout, and Pulling Punches\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 A player can announce that his character is trying to stun or knock his opponent out rather than damage her. Using the flat of a blade instead of the edge, for example, can accomplish this. Damage is figured normally, but any damage inflicted doesn\rquote t wound the opponent: it stuns her instead.\par In this case, a Hurt result is called a \ldblquote Stun\rdblquote  \emdash  a stunned character cannot attack or all-out defend, and is at \endash 1 to defend for one combat turn only. However, the Stun result stays on the character sheet: that is, a second Stun result, even if delivered more than one combat round after the first, will cause the character to become Very Stunned. (Stun results heal like Scratches: after combat is over.)\par A Very Hurt result in a stunning attack is called a Very Stunned result instead: no attacks and \endash 2 to all actions for two combat rounds.\par A result of Incapacitated or worse when going for stun damage results in a knockout. A knocked-out character doesn\rquote t need healing to recuperate to full health \emdash  just time. (Only a harsh GM would roll for the possibility of brain damage \emdash  this is fiction, not reality.)\par The GM may simply decide that a successful Good blow (or better) to the head knocks someone out automatically. In an Opposed action, the Good blow would also have to win the combat, of course.\par Likewise, a player may choose to have his character do reduced damage in any given attack. This is known as \ldblquote pulling your punch,\rdblquote  even if you are using a sword. This commonly occurs in duels of honor, where it is only necessary to draw \ldblquote first blood\rdblquote  to win, and killing your opponent can get you charged with murder. A Scratch will win a \ldblquote first blood\rdblquote  duel \emdash  it is not necessary to Hurt someone.\par To pull your punch, simply announce the maximum wound level you will do if you are successful. A fencer can say he is going for a Scratch, for example. In this case, even if he wins the Opposed action by +8, and adds in +3 for his sword, the worst he can do is nick his foe. He was just trying for a Scratch \emdash  but the Scratch is probably in the shape of the letter \ldblquote Z\rdblquote  with such a result!\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.63  Min-Mid-Max Die Roll\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 This system of wound determination does not pretend to be a realistic method, and can produce some wildly varying results. But it\rquote s quick, easy, and lots of fun, and so works well in a certain style of gaming.\par This system requires 3d6 for a damage roll, even if using 4dF for action resolution.\par Overview: roll 3d6 when a damage roll is called for. You will probably only read one of the dice, however: either the lowest value (Min), median value (Mid) or highest value (Max), depending on damage factor and relative degree. The greater the damage factor and/or relative degree, the greater the d6 you read for result.\par If using the Min-Mid-Max system, use the wound track on the character sheet listed in Section 4.57, Recording Wounds:\par \par \tab \tab 1,2\tab \tab 3,4\tab \tab 5,6\tab \tab 7,8\tab \tab 9+\par Wounds:\tab Scratch\tab \tab Hurt\tab \tab Very Hurt\tab Incapac.\tab \tab Nr. Death\par \tab \tab [   ]  [   ]  [   ]\tab [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\tab \tab [   ]\par \par The offensive and defensive damage factors listed in Section 4.54, Sample Wound Factors List, are used.  However, they are not added to the relative degree. Instead, simply derive the total damage factor as normal: (attacker\rquote s Strength + Scale + weapon) minus (defender\rquote s Damage Capacity + Scale + armor). Each player should jot down this number once it is known for the combat.\par Before the game begins, the GM decides how important the damage factor and relative degree are in determining wound severity. The following table is recommended as a starting point; the GM can adjust it as she sees fit:\par \par \tab Damage\tab \tab Bonus\tab \tab Relative Degree\par \tab  Factor\par \tab < 0\tab \tab \endash 1\tab \tab \emdash \par \tab 0,1,2\tab \tab 0\tab \tab 2,3\par \tab 3,4,5\tab \tab +1\tab \tab 4,5\par \tab 6+\tab \tab +2\tab \tab 6+\par \par A damage factor of 3, for example, has a die-reading bonus of +1, while a relative degree of 3 has a die-reading bonus of 0. The GM may charge a \endash 2 penalty if the damage factor is well below zero (\endash 5 or worse).\par Since the graze rules are used unchanged with this system, there is no listing for relative degree less than 2.\par Add the bonus for damage factor with the bonus for relative degree to get a final bonus. Example: a character has a damage factor of +3 (bonus: +1) and a relative degree of +5 (bonus: +1).  His total bonus for that round of combat is +2.\par What do these bonuses represent?\par A total \ldblquote bonus\rdblquote  of less than zero means no damage is possible \emdash  don\rquote t even roll the dice. Otherwise, locate the total bonus on the following table:\par \par \tab \par \tab Total Bonus\tab Die to Read\par \tab 0\tab \tab Min\par \tab 1\tab \tab Mid\par \tab 2\tab \tab Max\par \tab 3\tab \tab Add Max + Min\par \tab 4\tab \tab Add all three\par Min = lowest die.\par Mid = median die.\par Max = highest die.\par \par The median is the value in the middle. This may be the same as the highest or lowest, as in a roll of 2, 4, 4: the Min = 2, the Mid = 4, and the Max = 4. A roll of triples means Min = Mid = Max. (Please read the median value \emdash  not necessarily the die that is physically between the other two on the table.)\par Once you have determined which die to read, compare it with the numbers above the wound levels. With a roll of 1, 3, 5, for example, the Min die = 1 (a Scratch result), the Mid die = 3 (a Hurt result), and the Max die = 5 (a Very Hurt result). You would only read one of these results, however \emdash  not all three.\par With three or more bonuses, add the appropriate dice as listed on the table. For results beyond 9, the GM is free to kill the recipient outright, or merely keep it as a Near Death result, as called for by the situation.\par The tables are not meant to be intrusive, merely guidelines. The basic intent is to read the Mid if the attacker has either a decent damage factor or a decent relative degree; to read the Min if he has neither; and to read the Max if he has both. All other values are derived from that simple idea. So the GM can ignore all the tables, and with that idea in mind, just fudge which die to read.\par For example, a GM might say, \ldblquote Whoa! You just hit him across the forehead as he backed into a bucket left by the hastily fleeing janitor. Nice shot \emdash  he topples over onto his back. For damage, roll 3d6 and read the Max!\rdblquote \par This would have come out of a descriptive game, in which the players describe their characters\rquote  actions in great detail.\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Example of the Min-Mid-Max system:\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Valorous Rachel is fighting the villainous Archie. Both are Scale 0, so Scale won\rquote t be mentioned.\par \par Rachel:\par \tab Quarterstaff: +2\par \tab Strength Fair: +0\par \tab \tab Offensive damage factor: +2\par \tab Light Leather Armor: +1\par \tab Damage Capacity Good: +1\par \tab \tab Defensive damage factor: +2\par Archie:\par \tab Greatsword: +4\par \tab Strength Great: +2\par \tab \tab Offensive damage factor: +6\par \tab Heavy Leather Armor: +2\par \tab Damage Capacity Fair: +0\par \tab \tab Defensive damage factor: +2\par \par So Rachel\rquote s damage factor is 2\endash 2 = 0. She gets no bonus.\par Archie\rquote s damage factor is 6\endash 2 = 4.  He gets +1 bonus, according to the table above.\par On the first round, Rachel wins by +2, whacking Archie across the ribs. Relative degree +2 doesn\rquote t get any bonus (and she has none from her damage factor), so Rachel will read the Min. She rolls 3d6 and gets lucky: a 3, 5, and 6. The Min is a 3: she Hurts Archie, who is now at \endash 1 and checks off his Hurt box.\par On the second round, Archie manages to win with a graze: +1 relative degree. Do not even calculate a bonus in this case \emdash  use the graze rule unchanged from Section 4.56, Grazing. His damage factor is only 4, so he scores a Scratch on Rachel.\par On the third round, Archie does very well: he wins by +4 as Rachel backs into a chair! He now gets two bonuses, one from his damage factor and one from his relative degree: he will read the Max die. But Archie\rquote s karma is in serious need of overhaul: he rolls a 1, 2, and 3. Rachel is only Hurt, and the GM checks off the Hurt box.\par Rachel all-out attacks in the following round, and with the +1 to hit she scores an awesome +6 over Archie! She gets two bonuses for such a high relative degree \emdash  she\rquote ll read the Max die \emdash  and gets +1 to the die roll for all-out attacking. (Note that this is +1 to the die result, not a +1 to the die-reading bonus.) The GM rolls a 1, 4, 6. She reads the Max and adds 1 for a total of 7. Reading the wound table on the character sheet, she sees that this is Incapacitated, and declares that Rachel\rquote s staff just smashed across the bridge of Archie\rquote s nose, probably doing serious damage, and at least knocking him out of this battle\u8230\'c9.\par For a more epic game, where it\rquote s important to be able to Incapacitate in one blow, use the following wound track on the character sheet:\par \par \tab \tab 1\tab \tab 2,3\tab \tab 4,5\tab \tab 6\tab \tab 7+\par Wounds:\tab Scratch\tab \tab Hurt\tab \tab Very Hurt\tab Incapac.\tab \tab Nr.

In most campaigns, PC death shouldn\rquote t occur through a bad die roll, but only if the character\rquote s actions were truly self-sacrificing \endash  or stupid \endash  enough to warrant death. Three methods of preventing accidental PC death are presented. They may be used separately or together or not at all.\par These should not be used for run-of-the-mill NPCs, but could be used for major ones.\par The \ldblquote automatic death\rdblquote  rule in Section 4.51, Wound Levels, takes precedence over these suggestions.\par 1) A character cannot take more than three levels of wounds in one blow. For example, an unwounded character could be Scratched, Hurt, or Very Hurt in one blow, but any excess damage points beyond that would be lost. A Hurt character could go all the way to Near Death in one blow, but not be killed outright.\par 2) A character cannot be rendered Near Death unless he began that combat round Incapacitated. This is simpler to keep track of than the first system, and assumes there is some great difference between a severe wound and mortal wound. There probably isn\rquote t, but the rule isn\rquote t intended to be realistic: it\rquote s to make the PCs more heroic than real life.\par 3) A player may spend a Fudge Point (Section 1.36) to convert a deadly wound to a merely serious one.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 4.65  Technological Levels as Scale\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Technological differences between weapons and armor can be expressed as Scale if the GM desires. Instead of figuring exactly how much mega-damage a transvibrational subneural pulverizer does, the GM can simply say, \ldblquote This is a weapon that is of the same technological level as the armor of the defender \emdash  therefore, it has the same effect on her as a modern pistol would on kevlar.\rdblquote  However, if used against someone who is wearing kevlar, the transvibrational subneural pulverizer does lots and lots of damage \emdash  kevlar wasn\rquote t designed to stop this type of thing.\par Basically, there isn\rquote t much difference between thrusting a sword through a naked man\rquote s kidney, or shooting him with a .38 through the kidney, or using a transvibrational subneural pulverizer on the kidney: naked people don\rquote t resist most weapons well. Plate armor stops the sword well, but won\rquote t slow down the .38 enough to help much \emdash  unless it can deflect it away from the kidney, that is. It probably won\rquote t help at all against the pulverizer, but it may: the GM will have to decide the effect of such a weapon on plate armor.\par The concept of technological levels as Scale only comes into effect when weapons of one technological era are used against armor of another technological era. At that point, the GM can add an arbitrary Scale difference to the weapon \emdash  or armor, whichever is of the higher tech level. No attempt to quantify tech levels is made here. This section is merely food for thought.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 4.7  Combat and Wounding Example\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 This example uses the numerical offensive and defensive factors in Section 4.54, Sample Wound Factors List. It also uses a damage die roll: the 4dF option, with the three limitations listed.\par The two opponents are Medieval warriors, Snorri and Brynhild. The fight takes place in a barroom, which quickly empties of other occupants once weapons are drawn. No one noticed that the innkeeper\rquote s son had actually left much earlier than this, when the belligerent Snorri was merely exchanging insults with the proud Brynhild. Both fighters are human (Scale 0), so Scale is left out of the discussion.\par \par Snorri:\par Sword skill: Great\par No shield\par Strength: Good (+1)\par Weapon: Magic Sword\par \tab \tab (+2 for size, +1 for Sharp, +1 for Magic = +4)\par \tab Offensive damage factor: +5\par Damage Capacity: Good (+1)\par Armor: Heavy Leather (+2)\par \tab Defensive damage factor: +3\par \par Brynhild:\par Axe skill: Good\par Shield: Medium (\endash 1 to foe\rquote s weapon skill)\par Strength: Great (+2)\par Weapon: Axe (+2 for size, +1 for Sharpness = +3)\par \tab Offensive damage factor: (+5)\par Damage Capacity: Fair (+0)\par Armor: Heavy Leather (+2)\par \tab Defensive damage factor: (+2)\par \par Snorri\rquote s damage factor vs. Brynhild: 5-2 = +3\par Brynhild\rquote s damage factor vs. Snorri: 5-3 = +2\par Snorri\rquote s skill is reduced to Good for this combat by Brynhild\rquote s shield \emdash  see Section 4.31, Melee Modifiers.\par In the first round, Snorri gets a Great result on his weapon skill (die roll = +1), and Brynhild gets a Fair result (die roll = \endash 1). Snorri wins with a relative degree of +2. Snorri\rquote s damage factor of +3 is added in, bringing the damage to +5. Looking at the character sheet, a +5 result equals a Very Hurt wound \emdash  before rolling for damage.\par The GM is requiring damage rolls, so Snorri\rquote s player rolls the dice: a \endash 2 result, too bad. This brings the damage down to 3. Since Brynhild is an NPC, the GM looks at the wound chart on her character sheet, and finds 3: a Hurt Wound. The GM marks off the box under the word \ldblquote Hurt,\rdblquote  and the next round is fought. Brynhild is now at \endash 1 for the rest of the combat.\par In the second round, both combatants get Good results \emdash  a standoff. The GM describes it as a give-and-take of blows that are all parried or blocked as the fighters circle each other. Another five seconds have passed this round, the GM decrees.\par In the third round, Snorri gets a Great result and Brynhild only a Good result \emdash  Snorri has hit again. Since the relative degree is +1, this is a graze. The GM does allow a damage die roll on a graze, but won\rquote t let it change the result by more than one level. Snorri\rquote s damage factor of +3 normally means a Scratch on a graze.\par Snorri rolls a 0 for damage, so the GM marks off a Scratch box on Brynhild\rquote s character sheet.\par In the fourth round, Snorri decides to finish off the Hurt Brynhild in one blow: he all-out attacks, which gives him a +1 modifier to his skill, and a +1 to damage if he wins. Brynhild had decided to try for a situational advantage, though: she\rquote s spending this round in all-out defense, hoping to spot some way to get an advantage over Snorri for the fifth round. Brynhild gets a +2 modifier to her skill this turn, but can\rquote t hurt Snorri if she wins. Snorri gets a Great result, even counting his +1 for all-out attacking, and Brynhild also gets a Great result. Snorri would ordinarily have lost the combat round (all-out attackers lose tie results), but Brynhild\rquote s all-out defense means she doesn\rquote t aim any blows at Snorri, just beats his attack down.\par The GM requires a Good Perception roll from Brynhild in order to spot a situational advantage. Her Perception attribute is Great, so she easily makes it. She notices a drink on the floor, spilled earlier by a customer in full flight. Since she successfully defended that round, the GM rules she maneuvers Snorri into the slippery puddle for one round.\par In the fifth round, the GM gives Snorri a \endash 1 to skill this round (down to Fair) for bad footing. Snorri tries an ordinary attack, and Brynhild, wounded, desperate, and sensing this may be her only chance, now tries an all-out attack: +1 modifier to her skill, bringing her up to an effective skill of Good from her wounded Fair state.

Scratches are usually erased after a battle, provided the characters have five or ten minutes to attend to them. An individual GM may rule otherwise, of course: they may linger on for a day or two.\par A Good result on a healing skill heals all wounds one level (Hurt to healed, Very Hurt to Hurt, etc.). (Scratches do not count as a level for healing purposes. That is, a Hurt wound that is healed one level is fully healed.) A Great result heals all wounds two levels, and a Superb result heals three levels.\par Healing with realistic medical skills takes time: the success of the roll merely insures the wounds will heal, given enough rest. How long this takes depends on the technological level of the game setting, and is up to the GM. (A day per treated wound is extremely fast healing, but may be appropriate in an epic-style game. Likewise, one minute per magically healed wound is fast.) Whether or not strenuous activity before the healing period ends reopens a wound is also left up to the GM\u8230\'c9.\par Example: a character with three wounds (two Hurt results and one Very Hurt) is healed with a roll of Good. After the appropriate time, the two Hurt wounds will be fully healed, while the Very Hurt wound will now be a Hurt wound (and carries a \endash 1 modifier as such).\par Otherwise, wounds heal on their own at one wound level per week of rest \emdash  or longer, if the GM is being more realistic. That is, after a week of rest, an Incapacitated character becomes Very Hurt, etc. The GM may also require a successful roll against a Constitution attribute: Fair Difficulty Level for Hurt, Good Difficulty Level for Very Hurt, and Great Difficulty Level for Incapacitated. Failing this roll slows the healing process. Someone Near Death should take a long time to heal, even with magical or high tech healing.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\i\fs28\kerning1 Chapter 5: Character Development\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 After playing a bit, perhaps each session, a player will want the character to grow in abilities.

If a long campaign is planned, these EP costs could be doubled to allow room for character growth.\par Defining skills narrowly will also ensure characters don\rquote t become too powerful too quickly.\par As a guideline, good role-playing should be rewarded with 1 to 3 EP per gaming session, with a suggested upper limit of 4 EP for flawless role-playing. Players may save EP as long as they wish.\par Attribute levels may or may not affect EPs put into skills. For simplicity, you can ignore attribute levels entirely when raising skill levels. For greater realism, however, the GM can add a surcharge of +2 EP (or more) when a skill is raised above an appropriate attribute.\par Example: Violet the Herbalist has Good Intelligence.  EP costs for raising Herb Lore skill are normal until she tries to raise it to Great, which is higher than her natural Intelligence. At that point, she must pay +2 EP beyond what the table calls for: 6 EP to raise Herb Lore to Great, and another 10 EP to raise it to Superb.\par This proposal is recommended only for character development \emdash  not for character creation. The GM should inform the players at character creation if this option is in force so they can plan their characters\rquote  attributes accordingly.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 5.3  Development through Training\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Improving skills through EP is not always realistic, to be honest. A gaming session might only cover a few hours of campaign time. Allowing a character to improve one or two different skills from Fair to Good in that time is far-fetched. But it\rquote s fun for the players, and psychologically satisfying, and so recommended.\par As an alternative, or in addition to the methods described above, the GM may allow traits to be raised through appropriate amounts of training time. This would require finding a teacher (which would cost money) or taking an appropriate job (which may not be totally dedicated the skill you wish to learn, and so take longer). It\rquote s also possible to learn something on your own, but the GM should double the time required. If using the Objective Character Development system, the GM may (or may not) require that EPs be spent in this manner \emdash  that is, you can\rquote t spend EPs unless you also take the time to train.\par The GM sets training time and costs, and difficulty of finding a teacher. The teacher has two skills that must be considered: Teaching skill, and the appropriate skill being taught. The player may need to roll the dice to see how diligently the character studied the skill. The die roll should be on an attribute such as Willpower, Drive, Zeal, Wisdom, Self Discipline, Self Motivation, Psyche, Intelligence, etc. If the player can give a valid reason why the character is extremely motivated to learn this skill, the GM may grant up to +2 to the trait tested. The GM may request a single die roll, or a roll per week, month, etc. If multiple rolls are called for, at least half of them should succeed to earn the skill improvement.\par Example: Billy Blaster, space cadet, is back at the Academy after his first tour of duty. He considers his Fair Laser Pistol skill to be substandard. He takes a six-week training course in Laser pistol use, taught by an instructor of Superb Laser skill and Great Teaching skill. (Since Billy has Gift: Employed by Space Patrol, this is free training for him.) The GM decides that Billy\rquote s player needs to make a Willpower roll for each two-week period to see how dedicated he is to studying. If at least two of the three rolls are Mediocre or better, Billy can raise his Laser pistol skill from Fair to Good, given the length of training and quality of the instructor. Had the training been shorter, or the instructor worse, he would have needed a preponderance of Fair or even Good rolls to have successfully raised his Laser pistol skill.\par Remember that it is much easier to improve a skill from Poor to Mediocre than from Great to Superb. Require more time, or higher Difficulty Levels on the Will rolls to raise an already high skill.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 5.4 Alternative Experience System\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Note: The following was taken from the author\rquote s \ldblquote Thoughts on Fudge\rdblquote  (online at http://www.io.com/~sos/rpg/fudlatest.html).\par After a convention game one time, Ann Dupuis and I were discussing how well the game went, especially with the one newcomer to gaming at the table. The woman was not only at her first convention, but was playing her first RPGs that weekend. Fudge was the last game in her schedule that con, and she was blown away by how easy it was compared to the other games. She said she understood the character sheet without having to have anything explained to her \endash  and that the single mechanic to resolve all actions was the best she\rquote d seen in the five different games she\rquote d tried.\par So we were congratulating ourselves, when I mentioned to Ann (President and Dictator for Life of Grey Ghost Games) that Fudge did have its drawbacks \endash  experience being the most glaring. Yes, it\rquote s great for one-shot con games, but it seems to allow characters to develop too quickly or not at all in long-term games.\par Ann came up with an idea which we batted around a bit, and it looks something like this:\par Instead of awarding Experience Points, the GM awards Fudge Points at the end of a gaming session. These can be turned in for Experience Points, but the ratio in Section 1.36 (suggested 3 EP = 1 Fudge Point) is reversed. That is, you may turn in three Fudge Points for one EP.\par Raising traits is unchanged from Chapter 5.\par What this does is force the player to consider whether he needs to save his Fudge Points to get out of a jam the next session, or convert them to EP to raise a trait. He can save Fudge Points from session to session, so he can eventually swap 12 Fudge Points for 4 EP to raise a trait or two \endash  but he may have to use some of those Fudge Points along the way to survive!\par The net effect is that character development is left totally in the hands of the player, but is slowed down from the rate suggested in the book. This means a long-term campaign becomes more viable in Fudge.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\i\fs28\kerning1 Chapter 6: Tips and Examples\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 6.1  GM Tips and Conversion\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Always remember the main point of the game is to have fun\u8230\'c9.\par The GM should translate at least one of her favorite characters into Fudge from whatever system she is used to.

Figure roughly how many levels have been spent on combat skills by the average player character. This figure, put into combat skills in an NPC, should give a fair fight. For example, if the PCs are built on 40 skill levels and four free attribute levels, the average character might have ten levels in combat skills directly.

The GM can change or ignore any that she wishes and create new character classes. She can also create classes for other genres, such as for a science fiction setting.\par Each character class has unlisted Knowledge skills appropriate to its class. For example, a fighter has Good Knowledge of tactics, determining weapon quality, judging how well-trained an army is by observing it for a while, etc. Likewise, a rogue has Good Knowledge of types of locks, how many guards a wealthy merchant might have, the value of a given material for disguising oneself, etc.\par Some skills listed on page 126 as being under one heading fall under another in certain cases. For example, a rogue would be Great at climbing, even though Climbing is listed as an Athletic skill. In this case, it\rquote s a Covert skill. The ability to move quietly is listed as a Covert skill, but a fighter would be Fair at it, and a ranger Great.\par Character development in this system is handled normally. The GM must decide at some point whether to continue to use broad skill groups or to break skills down into finer divisions. Each skill must be raised separately if the GM decides to break the broad groups into finer distinctions. If the GM likes keeping the skills together as groups, then raising an entire skill group level should cost more experience points than in a system with narrowly-defined skills \emdash  perhaps as much as ten times the cost.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 6.43  Cercopes (Fantasy Race)\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Cercopes (or Kerkopes) were originally a pair of brothers in early Greek mythology. By the first century BC, however, mythological writers had expanded them into their own race. It is in this later definition that they are used here.\par Cercopes (singular: cercop) are a small, apish race that love to play tricks and pranks on anyone they can. Born thieves, some of them even dared to steal Heracles\rquote  weapons! When he caught them and tied them to a pole for punishment, they amused him so with their jokes and banter that he let them go. Players should not attempt to play a cercop unless they have a roguish sense of humor.\par Cercopes are small humanoids with ugly, apelike faces and a prehensile tail. A cercop stands about four feet high (120 cm), but generally stoops a bit. The face is not hairy, but both sexes tend to have long sideburns that often meet under the chin \emdash  this hair does not continue to grow, but stays the same length, as monkeys\rquote  hair does. The bodies have some scant hair on the back, and the tail is furred except for the final six inches (15 cm). Arms, legs and chests have no more hair than the average human male does, and they wear clothing \emdash  with a tail hole. Their feet resemble monkeys\rquote  feet, but they cannot manipulate things well with them. They are not fond of shoes, only wearing them when attempting to disguise themselves as another race. \par Cercopes stand upright most of the time, but lean forward to run, with the tail acting as a counterbalance. Their tails are strong enough to be used in combat and to aid in climbing. However, a cercop cannot do fine manipulation (such as pick a lock) with its tail. Cercopes speak their own language, and need to learn another to speak with the rest of the party.\par The average cercop has a Mediocre Strength and Damage Capacity, but a Good Dexterity. Their intelligence runs the same range as humans.\par Cercopes have the racial gifts of Exceptional Balance (+2 to any action requiring balance, even in difficult situations), the Ability to Land on their Feet with no harm from twice the distance a human could, and Prehensile Tail.\par Their racial faults are Impulsiveness (act first, think later), Compulsive Jokers (practical and otherwise), Kleptomania, Unattractive Appearance to other races, and Bad Reputations as Thieves and Tricksters.\par They have a bonus of +1 to the following skills: Acrobatics, Move Quietly, Climbing and Fast Talk. They have a \endash 1 penalty to use any weapon of Medium size or bigger.\par The net result is that it counts as a fault to be a Cercop. Since anyone playing such a character actually gets some useful bonuses if playing a thief, the GM should be sure to enforce the faults \emdash  especially the Bad Reputation. NPCs will have a hard time trusting a cercop, usually with good reason.\par This racial template gives a strong incentive to creating a thief character. However, it is possible to make a cercop warrior or even cleric if desired. Certain faults can be \ldblquote bought off.\rdblquote  That is, a character may have a gift of Not a Kleptomaniac \emdash  but it costs one gift, which would nullify the free fault level. However, the Unattractive Appearance and Bad Reputation cannot be bought off \emdash  these are inherent prejudices in others, not in one\rquote s self.\par A cercop character could take a fault: No Tail \emdash  perhaps he lost it in battle. This would give extra levels to overcome the \endash 1 penalty to all medium and large weapons if a character wished to be a warrior cercop, for example.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 6.5  Animal & Creature Examples\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Non-PC animals need not be built using level limits.

And finally, some people will make fun of anyone carrying such a shoddy-looking weapon.\par When the sword was new, however, it had:\par \par Attributes:\par Sharpness: \tab Good\par Sturdiness: \tab Great\par \par Gift:\par Beautifully Made\par \par In that case, it would indeed merit the +1 for Sharpness (perhaps any Sharpness level of Mediocre to Good gets the +1 Sharpness bonus, while duller blades get no bonus, and better blades might get an additional +1 bonus). It also would never break under ordinary circumstances, and its appearance probably earns its owner a positive reaction from many people.\par A bejewelled magic sword found in a dragon\rquote s hoard might have:\par \par Attribute:\par Appearance: \tab Superb\par (+3 to impress those who value wealth)\par \par Gift:\par Troll-slaying (+3 to hit when fighting Trolls; such wounds will never heal)\par Fault:\par Dedicated Purpose (it tries to control the wielder to hunt trolls)\par \par Skill:\par Dominate Wielder: Fair (Opposed action against a Will attribute)\par \par A different magic sword:\par \par Supernormal Power:\par Flame Creation (+2 damage)\par \par Skill:\par Flame Shooting: \tab Great\par \tab (Range: 3 yards or meters)\par \par Fault:\par Flame Creation only works on a Good or better Situational roll\par \par \par Of course, even if the flaming missile fails, it can still be used as a regular sword, so it\rquote s not exactly worthless in such cases.\par As a final example, consider a science fiction double-seat fighter spaceship:\par \par Attributes:\par Acceleration: \tab Great\par Handling: \tab Superb\par Speed: \tab Good (Scale 15)\par Size: \tab Fair (Scale 8)\par \par Skills:\par Navigation: \tab Good\par Targeting: \tab Superb\par Auto-pilot: \tab Fair\par Food Preparation: \tab Poor\par Entertainment: \tab Mediocre\par \par Gifts:\par Turret-mounted Laser Rifles, above and below\par Bucket Seats in the bridge\par Hyperdrive\par Can be used in an atmosphere or in deep space\par \par Faults:\par Non-standard parts (expensive to repair)\par Unattractive exterior\par Cramped sleeping quarters\par Airlock squeaks annoyingly\par \par Ordinary, every-day equipment should not be detailed out in this manner. There is no need to define a canteen, for example, as anything other than \ldblquote metal, 1 quart (liter) capacity.\rdblquote  Even for equipment that may have an impact on the game, such as weapons or thieves\rquote  tools, you do not need to have any more information than \ldblquote +2 offensive damage factor\rdblquote  or \ldblquote adds 1 to Pick Locks skill.\rdblquote \par It\rquote s best to restrict defining equipment in Fudge character terms to the truly extraordinary (such as magic items). Another use is when the equipment\rquote s powers may be used in an opposed action: in a car race, for instance, you need to know the relative speeds and handling capabilities of the vehicles as well as the skills of the drivers. A battle between spaceships is another good example.\par Equipment with personality, such as sentient magic items or advanced robots, may be treated as full-fledged Fudge characters if desired.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\i\fs28\kerning1 Chapter 7: The Addenda\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 \par The Addenda consist of a variety of supplementary material for Fudge.\par Chapters 1 through 5 represent plain, vanilla Fudge \emdash  here you can find and create fancier fare.

There are two game effects: the greater the power, the easier it is to cast more powerful spells; and power levels act as a reserve in case of severe failure, which temporarily drains Power. Voluntarily draining a level of Power can also guarantee success for one spell.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Source of Power: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 manipulation of local area mana.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Reliability: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Fair.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Time to cast spells:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  depends on potency of spell (one minute to days). This can be speeded up by taking a penalty to the roll.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Spells: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 improvised. Exact wording isn\rquote t important, so magic books tend to be collections of effects, not formulae.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Material Components:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  none needed, but good use can give a +1 bonus to skill.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Drawbacks:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  casting non-trivial spells is fatiguing; severe failure causes distress.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Societal constraints: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 none \emdash  magic is rare, but not unheard of.\par This system is based on the conviction that a player using magic should never be blas\u233\'8e: there should always be some tension and excitement when a character casts a spell, or the magic has gone out of the game. Too often in a role-playing game, the player running a magician uses tried-and-true spells so regularly that spell-casting becomes mundane. Since \ldblquote mundane magic\rdblquote  seems a contradiction in terms, Fudge Magic attempts to instill a little excitement into spell-casting.\par There are many ways to achieve this. Fudge Magic has chosen the following limitations:\par 1) The mana available for a specific spell result gradually becomes depleted in a given area. That is, casting two fireballs in a row is harder than casting one fireball and one lightning blast, for example.\par 2) Magic is an untamable force; there is a skill cap for casting spells.\par 3) Magic is somewhat risky to use \emdash  there are penalties for severe failure.\par Options are provided to alter these limitations for GMs who dislike them. In fact, Section 7.193, Spell-Casting Skill Alternatives, is essential for Faerie races and demigods, who have much more dependable magic powers than humans. (Unless the GM is generous, such characters would have to buy higher skill levels normally if using the Objective Character Creation system. Taking some faults to balance such Powers is in keeping with the nature of demigods and Faerie races.)\par See Section 6.31 for sample characters using Fudge Magic.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.11  Magic Potential\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Magic Potential is a Supernormal Power. (A suggested cost in the Objective Character Creation system is two gifts for each level of Magic Potential. This can be reduced in a magic-rich campaign.) A character with at least one level of Magic Potential (usually abbreviated to Potential, sometimes simply called Power) is referred to as a \ldblquote magician\rdblquote  in these rules \emdash  substitute your favorite word. Only magicians may cast spells. (However, see Section 7.192, Magicians & Non-Magicians, for other options.) Magic Potential may be taken more than once, but each level counts as a separate supernormal power.\par Each level of Magic Potential must be bought as a specialization. Specializations can be suggested by the player or set by the GM. (In the latter case, she should make a list of acceptable magic specializations.) The categories can be as broad or as narrow as the GM wishes \emdash  the broader the terms, the more powerful the magicians.\par Examples of specialized Potential: Alter Inanimate Material, Augury, Combat Magic, Communication Magic, Defensive Magic, Elemental Magic, Flying Magic, Healing Magic, Illusion, Information-Gathering Magic, Mind Control, Necromancy, Only Affects Living Beings, Only Affects Sentient Beings, Only Affects Technological Items, Shapeshifting, White Magic (cannot harm anyone, even indirectly), etc.\par A character may have Power levels in more than one specialization, unless the GM disallows it for some reason. Certain disciplines may have societal constraints: in most cultures, studying Necromancy is offensive and probably illegal. Mind Control, Invisibility, Teleportation, Illusion Magic, etc., might all be limited to government-approved magicians, at best. It\rquote s even possible that such magicians will be outlaws. Anything that can be used easily to commit a crime (especially assassination or thievery) will be difficult, if not impossible, to learn openly in most cultures. If a given culture allows such magic openly, it is sure to have powerful defenses against being damaged by it.\par Narrow specializations should probably cost less than one supernormal power: perhaps each specialized Potential is worth one gift.\par In order to cast a spell of a given result, the magician must have at least +1 Potential specialized in that type of magic (on the character sheet, that is: he may be temporarily reduced to 0 Potential). Someone with +1 Potential: Combat Magic and +2 Potential: Information-Gathering Magic could not cast a spell to create food in the wilderness, for example.\par Failing a spell miserably causes the temporary loss of a level of Magic Potential (see Section 7.15, Resolution). When this happens, the magician faints for at least one combat round. He needs a Good Constitution roll to wake up (roll each round). When he comes to, the magician may function normally, even attempting to cast the same spell again \emdash  if he hasn\rquote t dropped below 0 Potential.\par If a magician has two or more types of Potential that are appropriate for the spell being cast, and a loss of Potential is called for, the GM decides which type of Potential is reduced. For example, a magician has one level of Combat Magic and two levels of Fire Magic, and fails miserably on a fireball spell. The GM could say that he has lost either his one level of Combat Magic or one of his Fire Magic levels, but not one of each.\par If a magician drops to \endash 1 Potential in any given specialty, he immediately falls into a coma, lasting anywhere from an hour to a day (GM\rquote s decision). When he wakes, he must roll against his Constitution: on a Mediocre or worse roll, he takes a point of damage. He checks Constitution again at the end of every day he is active \endash  a failed result means another point of damage. These wounds cannot be healed until he recharges his Magic Potential back up to level 0.\par A magician with 0 Potential may still cast spells; a magician at \endash 1 Magic Potential, however, cannot attempt any magic spells that would involve that specialty. He may still cast spells of another specialty. For example, a magician who falls to \endash 1 Encyclopedic Magic can no longer cast a spell that allows him to open his blank book and read a magically-appearing encyclopedia entry on a specified topic. But he can still cast spells using his Animal Empathy Magic, allowing him to call and converse with wild animals, provided that Potential is still 0 or greater. He must still make a Constitution check for every day he his active, however, to see if his \endash 1 Encyclopedic Magic Potential is causing him wounds.\par Magic Potential may be recharged only by resting for one week per level. (GMs may alter this time to taste, of course: resting for one day is sufficient for more epic campaigns.) For example, a magician falls to \endash 1 Potential. Resting one week will bring him up to 0 Potential (and cure any wounds incurred by being active while at \endash 1 Potential). A second week of rest will bring him up to +1 Potential.\par No character may gain Magic Potential levels beyond his starting level except through Character Development \emdash  see Chapter 5.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.12  Spells\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 When a magician wishes to cast a spell, he describes the result he has in mind. The GM assesses how powerful such an effect would be, based on how prevalent magic is in her campaign. In a low-magic campaign, even a simple spell such as levitating the jail keys to an imprisoned character would be taxing. In a high-magic campaign, however, that would be a trivial spell, and even shooting forth a flash of lightning from a fingertip wouldn\rquote t be out of the ordinary.\par The potency of the spell can be modified by the magician\rquote s appropriate Power level. An \ldblquote average\rdblquote  magician has three levels of appropriate Power when casting a given spell. (Modify this number up or down for harder or easier magic.) That is, a spell is more difficult for a magician with less than three levels of an appropriate Power. Likewise, a magician with four or more appropriate Power levels treats a spell as more trivial than it would be for an average magician.\par \ldblquote Appropriate\rdblquote  Power does not have to be all of the same specialization so long as each Power governs the spell in question. For example, a spell to make a sword fly up and attack a foe could be governed by Flying Magic, Combat Magic, and Control Inanimate Material. If a magician had one level of each of those types of magic, the spell would be of average potency for him.\par A spell is then Trivial, Average, or Potent. (It may also be Very Trivial, or Very Potent, if the GM wishes. In fact, the players will undoubtedly propose truly awesome spells, which should be labeled as Extraordinarily Potent, or with some other impressive adjective.) The GM tells the player what the potency of a proposed spell is \emdash  any magician character would have a fairly good idea of a spell\rquote s potency.\par The spell\rquote s potency determines the Difficulty level. A spell of average potency has a Fair Difficulty level, while a Potent spell has a Difficulty level of at least Good. Likewise, a Trivial spell has a Difficulty level of Mediocre or Poor.\par The GM also decides the duration of the spell if it succeeds \emdash  seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc. The character may try to adjust this, subject to GM approval. For example, the magician can voluntarily take more fatigue or reduce the scope of the effect \emdash  or accept some other penalty \emdash  to lengthen the spell\rquote s duration. Rolling a higher relative degree can also mean the spell lasts longer. Some spells have permanent effects: healing (until wounded again), busting a hole in a wall (until repaired manually or by magic), teleporting to a distant place (until you come back), and so on. Of course, even these spell effects may be temporary in a given GM\rquote s world: healing only lasts a day and the wound reappears, or a hole in the wall fixes itself after a few minutes, or a teleported person automatically returns after an hour in the other location\u8230\'c9.\par The GM also needs to determine if there are any drawbacks to casting a spell. Fudge Magic assumes that spells are tiring to cast, and a magician reduces his Fatigue attribute when casting. The more potent the spell, the more the fatigue. (Fatigue is regained by resting, of course. If Fatigue goes below Terrible, the character passes out. The GM may have separate Fatigue attribute, or base it on Endurance, Constitution, Strength, etc.)\par A GM who dislikes the idea of keeping track of fatigue can change the drawback to something else. Perhaps a magician has a limited number of spells he can cast in a day (or in an hour). In this case, he may have a Spell Point attribute, which is drained by spell casting and regained simply by the passage of time. (A trivial spell won\rquote t drain any Spell Point levels, while an average spell drops a magician from Good Spell Points to Fair, for example, and more potent spells drain two or more levels at a time.) Draining spell points would not necessarily make the magician tired in this case, and Spell Points would regenerate whether the magician was resting or not \emdash  or they might only regenerate with sleep.\par Or maybe each spell affects a magician\rquote s Sanity attribute, and he needs to convalesce to restore it. Or, equally entertaining, a spell might affect the sanity of anyone who witnesses magic! Reduced sanity can manifest in many amusing ways\u8230\'c9.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.13  Mana\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Mana is an energy source capable of manipulating matter, time and space. It can be tapped only by those with Magic Potential.\par The GM determines the availability and density of mana in a given game world, just as she does the average potency of a spell. Mana density can affect two things: how large an area is needed to fuel a given spell effect, and (optionally), how easy or hard it is to cast a spell.\par When a spell of a particular effect is cast, the magician draws a specific type of mana to him to create the effect. The next time this same effect is desired, it will be harder to do: he has drained some of that mana type in the local area.\par The size of the area is defined by the GM. For most fantasy worlds, assume it\rquote s about 50 yards or meters in diameter. In a low-level magic campaign, the area is the size of a town or even city. (This would give meaning to the old line, \ldblquote This town ain\rquote t big enough for both of us\rdblquote  \emdash  dueling wizards!) On the other hand, a high-level magic campaign is so mana-rich that the magician can simply take a step or two and be in a new area. Note that the area governs which spells can be cast without penalty: if one magician casts a healing spell, a second magician will be at \endash 1 to cast a healing spell in the same area within the next 24 hours. (Mana may recharge at a different rate in a given game world, of course.) Note also that a magician may be unaware of what spells were cast in an area before he arrived\u8230\'c9.\par In a mana-rich area, spells may also be easier to cast: +1 or +2 to skill level. Likewise, in a mana-poor area, spells can be harder to cast: \endash 1 or more. The GM decides if this rule is in effect.\par Mana is dispersed and weak in a world such as modern Earth. The average fantasy game world will have much stronger mana, and some high-magic campaigns will simply reek of mana. In any given world, it is possible to vary the amount of mana. Some lands may be mana-rich, while neighboring areas are mana-poor. Mana may flow in currents, or in tides with the phases of the moon. There may be \ldblquote rogue\rdblquote  mana streams that change course and invade new areas, or a mana drought may afflict a given locale. Astrological alignments can affect mana, too \emdash  thus even here on mana-poor Earth there will be places and times of the year when cultists gather to call forth unseen powers\u8230\'c9.\par A PC magician would know the general mana level for at least his home area. He may or may not know whether it fluctuates periodically, or if far lands have different mana levels. In order to determine the mana level of the local area at a given time, a magician must cast a spell specifically to that end.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.14  Skill\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Spell-casting is a skill that must be learned. The default is Non-Existent, and, due to the element of uncertainty in Fudge Magic (mentioned in Section 7.1, Fudge Magic), the maximum base skill level is Fair. This cannot be raised permanently \emdash  but see Section 7.193, Spell-Casting Skill Alternatives.\par One generic Spell-Casting skill is assumed, but the GM may require more if she breaks magic down into different types. It should cost one level just to get a Spell-Casting skill at Terrible.\par Spell-casting skill may be modified (to a maximum of Great) by the following:\par Taking an average time to cast a spell: +0. (Note: the GM assesses the average time for any given spell proposed. Potent spells might take all day, or even longer, while Trivial ones might take one to five minutes.)\par Taking a long time to cast a spell carefully: +1. (Relative to each spell, of course. For a Trivial spell: taking a half an hour or more.)\par Casting a spell much more quickly than normal: \endash 1. (For a Trivial spell: one combat round of concentration.)\par Using normal effort to cast a spell: +0.\par Using extra effort to cast a spell (more fatigue than normal, or counts as two spells cast if there is a limit per day, or reduces Sanity more than normal, etc.): +1 or +2.\par Using less effort than normal to cast a spell: \endash 1 or more. (Reduced fatigue, or it only counts as half a spell against a daily limit, etc.)\par First spell-casting of a particular effect in a given area within 24 hours: +0. (See Section 7.13, Mana, for the size of an area.)\par Additional spell-castings of a particular effect in a given area within 24 hours: \endash 1 per casting.\par For using authentic magic formulae: +1. (The Law of Contagion or the Law of Similarity, for example \emdash  see James Frazer\rquote s classic anthropological study, The Golden Bough. Both Laws require some physical component: a feather to cast a flight spell, a piece of the subject\rquote s hair to heal or hurt her, a drop of water that becomes a water jet, a stick that becomes a staff, a bearskin to change the magician into a bear, etc. Drafting the spell in poetical form earns an additional +1, if the GM is willing.)\par Multiple magicians casting a spell that they have all tried before: +1 (for 2 to X magicians) or +2 (for more than X magicians). (X is set by the GM, anywhere from two to ten, or even more for low-magic campaigns. One magician is assumed to be the primary caster: roll only once against his skill.)\par Mana-rich area: +1 or +2 (optional).\par Normal mana area: +0\par Mana-poor area: \endash 1 or more (optional).\par Other modifiers may also apply, such as in a spell to search the mountains magically for someone you love (+1) or searching for someone you\rquote ve never met (\endash 1).\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.15  Resolution\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Each spell is then resolved as an Unopposed action: the Difficulty level is dependent on the spell potency. Spells of average potency have a Difficulty level of Fair, while more trivial spells have difficulty levels of Mediocre or Poor. (No spell has a Difficulty level of Terrible \emdash  magic just doesn\rquote t work at that level.) More potent spells have Difficulty levels of Good to Superb, or even beyond Superb if a truly powerful effect is desired.\par If the magician surpasses the Difficulty level, the spell occurs as he described it. The better the relative degree, the better the result. The magician suffers \endash 1 (or more) to his Fatigue attribute if the GM deems the spell is fatiguing. (If the GM has chosen some other drawback, of course, apply that instead.)\par Sometimes a skill roll is then needed to do something with the end result of a spell. For example, a fireball needs to be thrown accurately: use the Throwing Skill and Ranged Weapon rules in Chapter 4.\par If the magician equals the Difficulty level, then a watered-down version of the spell occurs. Either it will have a short duration, or reduced potency, or there is a time lag before the spell takes effect, etc. There may be an unexpected side effect, though it won\rquote t be harmful to the magician. There is no penalty for the magician beyond a possible \endash 1 or \endash 2 to Fatigue, at worst.\par If the magician rolls below the Difficulty level, however, he is adversely affected. The energy inherent in mana lashes out at the magician\rquote s psyche instead of being focused as desired. There may (or may not) be some visible magical effect, but it will not be the desired effect, and, if he rolled poorly enough, it may even be inimical to the magician\rquote s goals \emdash  or health\u8230\'c9.\par On a failed roll, the magician is stunned for one combat round (no actions or defense) and takes at least \endash 1 Fatigue. A Terrible result always fails.\par If he rolls a result of \endash 4, the spell automatically fails (no matter what the resulting level) and he also temporarily drains one level of his Magic Potential \emdash  see Section 7.11, Magic Potential, for effects. (This is the \ldblquote riskiness\rdblquote  of magic mentioned in Section 7.1, Fudge Magic.)\par Examples: Barney casts a spell, Create Pizza, of Average potency in a normal mana area and gets \endash 3: a Terrible result. The spell fails and Barney is stunned for a combat round, but he does not drain a level of Magic Potential because he did not roll a \endash 4. Later, in a mana-rich area (+1 to cast), Barney takes a long time (+1) to cast Detect Food, a very Trivial spell (Poor result or better needed for success). He has temporarily raised his skill to Great, the maximum allowed. He rolls a \endash 4 result, which is a Poor rolled result. Although the rolled degree is good enough to cast the spell, Barney still fails because he rolled a \endash 4 result. Barney not only doesn\rquote t detect any food, he also exhausts one level of Magic Potential \emdash  ouch!\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.16  Personal Magic Resistance\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 If the spell is one which attempts to Control another being \emdash  either mentally, physically or spiritually \emdash  Opposed action rolls are also called for. First, the magician casts the spell (as above); then he has to overcome the Personal Magic Resistance of the subject. Magic Resistance may be an attribute or gift (Willpower is a good choice, if there is no specific anti-magic trait), as the GM desires. Magic Resistance may even be a different attribute for different types of spells (a mental attribute for attempts to control the mind, etc.). Note that this second roll is Opposed \emdash  the subject of the spell gets a chance to resist it, and so can influence the result.\par If the GM is willing, the magician may use the result he just rolled as his skill level for the Opposed action. That is, if he rolled a Great result on the spell, he rolls the Opposed action as if his skill were Great. Otherwise, he uses the same level he rolled initially against.\par \ldblquote Control\rdblquote  can mean many things to different GMs. Personal Magic Resistance would resist an attempt to read someone\rquote s mind to one GM, but not to another. However, Magic Resistance does not resist any spell that calls or creates physical energy to lash out at another being. If the magician successfully creates lightning to blast the subject, it is not resisted by Personal Resistance; it is treated as a physical weapon.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.17  Certain Spell-Casting\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Sometimes a magician desperately needs a certain result. In this case, he may opt not to roll the dice at all, and simply drain one level of Magic Potential for a guaranteed success. He takes the usual penalties for losing a level of Potential \emdash  see Section 7.11, Magic Potential. This means he\rquote ll faint \emdash   be unconscious \emdash  after casting the spell, which limits the utility for certain spells. You can\rquote t control someone\rquote s mind when you are unconscious, for example\u8230\'c9.\par The GM may restrict this to Trivial spells, or non-Potent spells, or have no restrictions at all, beyond requiring the normal fatigue (or other) penalties. If the spell is one that could logically be resisted by the subject, however, the subject still gets a Resistance roll. In this case, the magician rolls as if his skill were Great.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.18  Enchanting Items\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Items may be permanently enchanted in this system. The magician works for a number of weeks or months (as required by the GM), depending on the number and potency of the spells desired, and the general availability of magic items in the campaign. At the end of each month (or week), the magician rolls against two skills: Spell-casting, and the appropriate Craft skill for the material being worked. The usual penalties apply on failing a spell roll. If he surpasses the Difficulty level on each roll, the spell is slowly being set into the item, one stage at a time. On a roll that only matches the Difficulty level, the work counts as only half a time period, but does progress the enchantment.\par Obviously, a mana-rich area will attract magicians, especially enchanters.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.19  Fudge Magic Options\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 These options offer ways to make Fudge Magic more sweeping, more reliable, less risky, and even make it available to non-magicians.\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.191  Generalized Magic Potential\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Some GMs may want the players to have sweeping powers. In this case, each level of Magic Potential allows a character to try any magic effect desired. This is in keeping with certain fictional settings in which learning magic involves general principles rather than specific spell effects. This makes for a very free and open game, which may or may not be to your tastes.\par This system still allows specializations. Simply use faults to limit a magician\rquote s ability to cast certain spells. See Section 6.311, Character Examples, Brogo the Scout.\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.192  Magicians & Non-Magicians\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The GM may allow non-magicians to cast spells. In this case, it is risky, as there is no Magic Potential \ldblquote cushion\rdblquote  \emdash  one severe failure is enough to devastate the character. Still, in an emergency, it may be worth the risk. Such a character would still need to have some Spell-casting skill, however. (But see Section 7.193, Spell-casting Skill Alternatives).\par As a substitute for Magic Potential specialization, the GM looks over the character sheet (checking traits, personality, and character background) and decides if a proposed spell would be appropriate for the character. The character must have some aptitude in the proposed spell subject, or he may not cast such a spell. For example, a trained fighter with no knowledge of book learning or foreign languages could conceivably try a combat spell, but not a spell to translate a book written in an unknown script.\par Of course, the same spell is of greater potency for a non-magician than for a magician. This probably means that a non-magician will only have a chance of casting a spell that a magician would consider trivial.\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.193  Spell-Casting Skill Alternatives\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Since tastes differ, and Fudge Magic tends to be undependable (see Section 7.1, Fudge Magic), three options are provided for more reliable spell-casting:\par 1) Use the basic Fudge Magic system, but allow a magician to improve his chances of casting a spell beyond Fair. At a cost of one gift (or even supernormal power), this may be raised to Good. At a cost of two more gifts (or supernormal powers), casting skill may be raised from Good to Great, the maximum.\par 2) GMs who want magic to be a lot more reliable can simply treat Spell-casting as any other skill. That is, it costs the usual skill costs to raise it to Good or even Great. Superb Spell-casting is not recommended for any but inherently magical races, even in high-level magic campaigns.\par 3) Spell-Casting is equal to the Willpower attribute, or perhaps Willpower\endash 2. (There may still be a ceiling of Great, Good, or even Fair for Spell-Casting, regardless of the level of Willpower.) This is especially appropriate for games in which non-magicians can cast spells \endash  see Section 7.192, Magicians & Non-Magicians. This is a potent option because the player doesn\rquote t have to buy Spell-casting skill for his character.\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.194  Less Risky Spell-Casting\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 To make spell-casting less risky (not necessarily a good thing \emdash  see Section 7.1, Fudge Magic), make it harder to drain a level of Potential.\par Examples (apply as many or as few as desired):\par 1) A magician cannot deplete a level of Magic Potential if he is attempting a Trivial spell. That is, if he rolls a \endash 4 on a Trivial spell, he fails the spellcasting, but doesn\rquote t lose a level of Magic Potential.\par 2) A magician cannot exhaust a level of Magic Potential if he is attempting a Trivial or Average spell.\par 3) A magician cannot deplete a level of Magic Potential if he takes enough time to get a +1 bonus for slow and careful spell-casting.\par 4) A level of Magic Potential can only be depleted on a hurried spell-casting attempt that fails badly.\par 5) A magician cannot drain a level of Magic Potential on the first spell cast each day, or when the moon is full, or if the mana level is low (not enough mana to backlash potently), etc.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 7.2  Sample Miracle System: Fudge Miracles\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Date: December, 1992\par By: Steffan O\rquote Sullivan\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Here is a sample miracle system (not generic), based on the following premises mentioned in Section 2.6, Miracles:\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Can miracles occur by petition: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Yes.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Who can petition: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Anyone. Holy persons have an advantage. (A holy person is one with the supernormal power: Divine Favor, and whose behavior is in synch with the deity\rquote s goals \endash  GM decision on how the player is role-playing.) Religious Investiture \endash  a social title that may or may not coincide with Divine Favor \endash  is not required, and, in fact, does no good if behavior is inappropriate.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Certainty of petitioned miracles: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Mediocre.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Broad or specific requests:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  Specific requests are more likely to be granted.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.21  Divine Favor\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Divine Favor is a supernormal power that can be taken more than once. Each time Divine Favor is taken, it is dedicated to a single deity. It is possible to have Divine Favor from more than one deity in a polytheistic world, or you can have multiple steps of Divine Favor from a single deity. Each step of Divine Favor counts as two supernormal powers (recommended).\par Divine Favor can be temporarily lost if the character does not act in accordance with the deity\rquote s desires. Usually a period of atonement is required to regain Divine Favor. This may be instantaneous for a merciful deity, or it may take up to a month for stricter deities. All steps are lost and regained as a unit when this happens.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.22  Petitioning a Miracle\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 A character may petition a miracle at any time. However, some deities do not like to be disturbed for trivial matters, and may ignore requests when it is obvious the character hasn\rquote t even tried to help himself.\par In Fudge Miracles, the petition should be fairly precisely worded. Rather than a simple, \ldblquote Please help me,\rdblquote  the character should focus the plea: \ldblquote We are starving, please feed us,\rdblquote  or, \ldblquote My friend is dying, please heal him.\rdblquote  A holy character can petition for any miraculous result desired, however \emdash  there is no established list of miracles.\par Characters without Divine Favor have a Petitioning skill of Poor (or Mediocre in a more deity-active game). Those with one or more steps of Divine Favor have a Petitioning skill of Fair. Petitioning skill cannot be raised. (In a high-level deity-active campaign, Petitioning skill can be raised to Good at the cost of one supernormal power.) Petitioning skill can be modified, however \emdash  see the next section.\par To resolve a petition, make an Unopposed action roll against Petitioning skill. Each step of Divine Favor grants the holy character one extra chance to roll the dice in a petition to his deity.\par On a Fair or worse result, the roll is a failure. If the character has any steps of Divine Favor from the same deity, he may roll again for each step (this does not count as a separate petition). He can stop at any point \emdash  only the last result rolled counts. This means a character with two steps of Divine Favor can try one, two, or three rolls. If he gets Good, Fair, and Mediocre results, in that order, the result of the petition is Mediocre.\par On a Fair or Mediocre result, the petition isn\rquote t answered by the deity, but the deity isn\rquote t annoyed by the petitioner. On Poor or worse result, however, the deity is angry with the character, and there will be a \endash 1 on the next petition attempt. If the deity is evil, a miracle may actually occur, but not one the petitioner is likely to enjoy\u8230\'c9.\par On a Good or better result, the petition is granted. The better the rolled result, the better the answer to the prayer. For example, a Good result heals one wound or wound level, while a Superb result totally heals the character. A Good result could call a wolf to defend the petitioner, while three lions might answer a Superb result. And so on.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.23  Modifiers to the Petitioning Skill Level\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The GM decides if any modifiers are applicable. Suggested modifiers:\par The petitioner\rquote s behavior has been strictly in accordance with the deity\rquote s desires: +1\par The petitioner\rquote s behavior has not been in accordance with the deity\rquote s desires: \endash 1 or more\par The petition will further the deity\rquote s desires: +1\par The petition goes against the deity\rquote s desires: \endash 1 or more\par The petition involves the deity\rquote s sphere of influence: +1  (Calling for a fireball from a fire god, for example. This is not appropriate for a Supreme God, whose sphere encompasses all things.)\par The petition involves an element antagonistic to the deity: \endash 1 or more (asking the Fire deity to use water, for example.)\par The petition is phrased too generally: \endash 1 or more\par The petitioner has not tried to help himself first: \endash 1 or more.\par The petition is too trivial to bother the deity with: \endash 1 or more\par The petition is a simple, but important, request: +1, provided the petitioner has exhausted his own abilities to accomplish this task.

Only psionicists have Powers and the skills to activate them, but everyone has a Psychic Reservoir to resist psionic attacks.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.31  Psionic Powers\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The GM must decide how precisely to define Psi Powers. Since each Power must be bought separately, defining them broadly makes for more powerful characters.\par The following chart (see right) shows some broad groups that include more narrowly defined Psi power groups listed with them. These in turn contain even more narrowly defined powers, which a GM may use as individual Powers if desired. This list may be regrouped, expanded, some powers disallowed, a narrowly defined group made into a broad group that includes other powers, etc. The list is not intended to be comprehensive, but merely a sample.\par The GM should let the players know what depth of Psi skills she is using. Each Power costs one Supernormal Power (two gifts).\par Putting one level in a Power gets it at Terrible. Powers may then be raised at the cost of two skill levels per level, if using the Objective Character Creation system. For example, raising Telekinesis Power to Poor requires two skill levels, and raising it to Mediocre would cost two more skill levels.\par If a GM envisions a psi-rich campaign, of course, the costs should be much cheaper. Allowing many free levels of Supernormal Powers is a good way to do this, but be cautious about trading them for mundane traits.\par Power levels define range, quantity or size of subject affected, etc. \emdash  see Section 2.7, Psi. A Fair Power can do whatever the default average is for the campaign world.\par Some tasks require a minimum Power level, as set by the GM. If the character has the Power, but not at the minimum level required, he may not attempt the action unless he uses Desperation Psionics (Section 7.35). If the psi has the appropriate Power at three or more levels above the minimum required, he is at +1 for that use.\par No psionic ability can be used unless the character has the Power listed on his character sheet.\par A character may take a latent psi Power at the cost of one gift. He can\rquote t use the Power (may not take any related psi skills), but later in the campaign he may spend EP equal to another gift to awaken the Power. He would then have to learn the skills to control the Power.\par It is also possible to take some interesting faults that will limit the nature (and reduce the cost) of any Power. \ldblquote Usable only in emergencies\rdblquote  is a common theme in fiction, for example.\par \tab \par Very Broad\tab Mildly Broad\tab \tab Narrow\par Groups\tab \tab Groups\tab \tab \tab Groups\par Antipsi\tab \tab Distort\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Nullify\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Resist\par ESP\tab \tab Astral Projection\par \tab \tab Telesense\tab \tab Clairaudience\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Clairvoyance\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Locate Object\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Locate Person\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Sense Aura\par \tab \tab Temporal Revelation\tab Postcognition\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Precognition\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Psychometry\par Psychokinesis\tab Control Animate\tab \tab Healing\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Levitation\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Metabolism Control\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Shapeshifting\par \tab \tab Control Inanimate\tab Force Shield\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Photokinesis\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Sonarkinesis\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Telekinesis\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Transmogrify Object\par \tab \tab Electrokinesis\tab \tab Alter Electric Current\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Control Electrical Devices\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Cyberpsi\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Electric Blast\par \tab \tab Temperature Control\tab Cryokinesis\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Pyrokinesis\par Telepathy\tab Empathy\tab \tab Emotion Control\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Emotion Sensing\par \tab \tab Mind Shield\par \tab \tab Mental Communication\tab Mind Reading\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Thought Sending\par \tab \tab Mental Control\tab \tab Alter Memory\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Persuasion\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Prevent Clear Thinking\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Send Violent Energy\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Telehypnosis\par \tab \tab Vampirism\tab \tab Borrow Skill\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Drain Psychic Reservoir\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Drain Health\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Drain Energy\par Teleportation\tab \tab \tab \tab Teleport Self\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Teleport Other\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Teleport Object\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Planar Travel\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab Open Dimension Portal\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.32  Psionic Skills\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 You cannot attempt any psionic action unless you have the specific skill to control the Power in question. Each Power must have an accompanying skill of corresponding broadness or narrowness (Control Telekinesis, Use Telepathy, Read Minds, etc.).\par The default for psionic skills is Non-existent. Raising a skill to Terrible costs one skill level, etc. Skills may be taken as high as Fair at the beginning of a game. (The GM may allow higher levels if the campaign is centered around psionic abilities.) They may be improved through normal character development, and new ones may be added if the GM is willing. The player should have a good story concerning awakening new skills, however.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.33  Psychic Reservoir\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Psychic Reservoir is a measure of raw psi power available. Like most attributes, Psychic Reservoir is at Fair for every character unless deliberately altered. The GM may set the default lower, and there may be a ceiling on how high Psychic Reservoir can be set.\par Merely having a Psychic Reservoir attribute does not mean the character is capable of actively using psi. Other psionic Powers and skills are necessary to activate the Psychic Reservoir.\par A low Psychic Reservoir can negatively modify any active psi ability, while a high Reservoir can be tapped to increase your chances of success \emdash  see Section 7.36, Psi Modifiers Summary.\par A psionicist taps his Psychic Reservoir when he uses a psychic skill. Ongoing use gradually drains a Reservoir, and short but heavy-duty use of a psi Power also drains a Reservoir, but normal brief use doesn\rquote t. However, a rolled degree of Terrible or worse on a psionic skill roll always lowers Psychic Reservoir a minimum of one level.\par A psionicist can also attempt to drain his Psychic Reservoir deliberately. This may be done to gain a bonus to a psionic skill (see Section 7.34, Psionic Actions), or to a Power (see Section 7.35, Desperation Psionics).\par There is no immediate penalty for dropping a level of Psychic Reservoir, as long as it remains Terrible or higher. However, your next use of psi may be affected: there is a negative modifier for using a Psychic skill when your Psychic Reservoir is below Fair.\par If the Psychic Reservoir is drained to below Terrible, the character immediately loses consciousness. It requires a Good roll versus a Constitution attribute to regain consciousness, which may be attempted every combat round.\par Even after regaining consciousness, a character with Psychic Reservoir below Terrible is in trouble. The GM may impose any type of affliction she desires on such a character until the Psychic Reservoir reaches at least Terrible. Suggested afflictions include mild insanity (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, etc.), physical debility (drooling, shaking, twitching, etc.), attribute reductions, and negative modifiers for even non-psi actions.\par A character can regain one level of his Psychic Reservoir for each week (or day, or whatever the GM sets) of rest, up to his current maximum level.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.34  Psionic Actions\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Two kinds of psionic action are possible, Opposed and Unopposed.\par An Opposed action is a psionic attack upon an unwilling subject. The attacker rolls against his specific psionic skill, and defender rolls against a Willpower attribute to resist. (A defender may have an appropriate psi skill to use instead, such as Mind Shield.) An example of an Opposed action would be an attempt to create fear in someone.\par Unopposed psionic actions usually target inanimate objects. An Unopposed action could be as simple as examining an object psychically, or as complex as opening a dimensional door at one\rquote s feet. Telekinetically hurling an object at a foe is an Unopposed action because the object, not the foe, is the subject of the psionic skill.\par When a Psi wishes to use an ability, the player describes the result he wants to the GM. The GM then assigns a Difficulty level to the action. Even if a psi overcomes a defender\rquote s Willpower roll to resist, he must still roll the Difficulty level or higher to succeed at a task.\par There may also be a minimum Power level needed in order to attempt an action. For example, telekinetically lifting a pencil might only require a Terrible Telekinesis Power, but lifting a large book might require a Mediocre Telekinesis Power, and lifting a car might require a Superb Telekinesis Power. If the psi\rquote s Power level is three or more above the minimum needed, he gets a +1 to his skill level.\par Note that mentally lifting a pencil might only require a Terrible Power level, but manipulating it to sign one\rquote s name would probably require a Superb skill result. To accurately forge another person\rquote s signature would not only require a Superb Telekinesis skill result, but also a Fair or better Forgery skill result.\par The time required to activate a psionic ability depends on the potency of the desired effect and the Power level of the character. It is set by the GM. This can range from a single combat round to hours of concentration. The individual can also vary the time concentrating (which must be uninterrupted) to speed up the results or increase the chances of success \emdash  see Section 7.36, Psi Modifiers Summary.\par The Psi now applies all modifiers and rolls against the Difficulty level using the appropriate skill. In an Opposed action, both parties involved make their rolls. On tie results, the status quo is maintained, whatever that may be.\par At this point, a psi (or animate target of a psionic attack) may attempt to sacrifice one or more levels of Psychic Reservoir to augment his rolled result. That is, if a psi fails in an Unopposed action, he may stress himself in an attempt to succeed. In an Opposed action, this can be considered two people locked in psionic combat, each struggling to boost their power a bit to overcome the other.\par To augment a rolled result, a Psionicist rolls against the psionic skill he just used, with current modifiers still effective. If the result is Good, he may sacrifice one level of Psychic Reservoir to give him a +1 on the result of the skill attempt. On a result of Great, he may sacrifice one or two levels, gaining +1 for each level, and on a roll of Superb or better, he may sacrifice up to three levels of Psychic Reservoir. On a result of Fair, Mediocre or Poor, there is no effect: he may not sacrifice a level of Psychic Reservoir, but there is no penalty for having tried. On a result of Terrible or worse, however, he not only drains one level of Psychic Reservoir, he also loses one level of rolled result. This can intensify any negative consequences of having failed.\par If one party of an Opposed action is successful in augmenting his rolled result, the other may then try to augment his. They may continue to trade sacrificing levels of Psychic Reservoir until one of them fails to change the result, or falls below Terrible Psychic Reservoir.\par Someone defending with no psionic abilities rolls against Willpower\endash 2 to augment his result.\par Once augmenting \emdash  if any \emdash  is complete, the GM decides the duration of the effects \emdash  the better the roll, the better the results. Some effects will be permanent, such as Healing. Continuous concentration may be required to sustain other effects; this may slowly drain one\rquote s Psychic Reservoir.\par Psionic abilities are sometimes dangerous to use. A rolled degree of Terrible or worse will usually result in the exact opposite of the desired outcome, or some other entertaining backfire. In addition, the psi loses one level of Psychic Reservoir, as outlined in Section 7.33. It may also have a gruesome result: brain hemorrhage, loss of sanity, or a similar outcome. A Terrible result on an Opposed psionic action can mean the loser is now psychically open to his opponent. Such an open channel to another\rquote s psyche means that if the winner has any psychic ability at all, he can automatically draw on the loser\rquote s Psychic Reservoir to power his own abilities. The GM should determine these effects based on the situation at hand.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.35  Desperation Psionics\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Ordinarily, if the minimum Power level of a proposed psionic action is higher than the character\rquote s Power level, the psionicist may not attempt the action at all. However, if one is desperate enough, he can try it \emdash  at a great price.\par For each level of Psychic Reservoir voluntarily drained before the skill roll, a psionicist can increase his Power level by +1. Simply pushing the Power level up to match the minimum level needed is all it takes to try the skill \emdash  but he is at \endash 2 to his skill for each level of Psychic Reservoir he drained for this attempt.\par Unlike augmenting a rolled result (as described in the previous section), draining one level of Psychic Reservoir before the die roll is automatically successful.\par This is obviously not for casual use: the risk of a Terrible outcome is much higher than normal, as well as the guaranteed drain on Psychic Reservoir. Nonetheless, if one were being attacked by the Spawn of The Other, a demon of tremendous power, one might try anything to survive.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.36  Psi Modifiers Summary\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Apply as many modifiers to the skill as are appropriate:\par \par \tab Psychic Reservoir Level:\tab Psionic Skill use at:\par \tab Mediocre\tab \tab \endash 1\par \tab Poor\tab \tab \tab \endash 2\par \tab Terrible\tab \tab \tab \endash 3\par \tab Below Terrible\tab \tab Prohibited\par \par Skill augmented by draining Psychic Reservoir: +1 per level\par Terrible or worse result on skill augmenting attempt: \endash 1\par Desperation attempts: \endash 2 per level of Psychic Reservoir drained\par Power level is 3 or more greater than necessary for the task: +1\par Concentration time reduced by half: \endash 1\par Concentration time doubled: +1\par Certain drugs, devices, fields, star alignments, areas, etc., can also have modifiers.

He currently has a Good Psychic Reservoir and an interesting assortment of psi Powers and skills. The GM decides that to move and control the yard mower is a Great Difficulty level task on Telekinesis skill. It requires only Mediocre Telekinesis Power, however. Yardmower Man has a Good Telekinesis Power but only Fair Telekinesis skill. It may be tough to do it well, but he\rquote s willing to try it.\par Yardmower Man declares he\rquote s going to spend twice as much time concentrating (+1) and is also under the influence of Batch-5, a psi-enhancing drug (+1). He rolls a \endash 1 result, which means a Good Telekinesis effort due to his modifiers. He just missed the Difficulty level. Since his power is adequate to move the lawn mower, he still mows the lawn telekinetically, but doesn\rquote t do a very good job. In fact, it looks sloppy: there are thin strips of unmowed grass here and there, and he took out half of his daisy bed with one poorly aimed swipe.\par Since this is a continued use, the GM decides that for each hour spent mowing he reduces his Psychic Reservoir by one level. It takes him two hours.\par The next day, Yardmower Man decides the director of the local government psionic research facility should be Molecularly Rearranged. (He\rquote s always snooping around, and has been known to lock up psis in the past.) The GM rules that Molecularly Rearranging a human other than the Psi himself is a Superb Difficulty level task against the Shapeshift skill, and requires at least a Great Shapeshift Power. It is also a taxing thing to do: it will drain one level of Psychic Reservoir at the end of the action. It will be opposed by the director\rquote s Presence attribute, which is as close as this campaign comes to willpower.\par Fortunately for Yardmower man, he has the Shapeshift Power and skill both at Superb level. He also consumes a double dose of Batch-5, giving him a +2 in the Opposed action, but severely risking side effects. His Psychic Reservoir is down to Mediocre from activities the night before (\endash 1 to skill). Yardmower man rolls a \endash 1 Result. This is modified \endash 1 for low Psychic Reservoir, and +2 for Batch-5, giving him a Superb Result.\par The poor director has a Good Presence and Fair Psychic Reservoir. He gets lucky and rolls a Great Presence result trying to resist the psionic attack. But Great is not good enough (Yardmower man got a Superb result), so he tries to augment his result by sacrificing a level of Psychic Reservoir to fight the rearrangement of his molecules. His sacrifice roll (against Presence) is a Good Result, so he increases his result to Superb. He\rquote s still holding on, but just barely. Also, his Reservoir will be Mediocre after this round of psychic combat.\par Yardmower Man, not to be outdone, attempts to sacrifice his own Psychic Reservoir. He started the combat with a Mediocre Psychic Reservoir and full of Batch-5, so he still applies the +1 overall modifier to his Superb Shapeshift skill on his augmentation roll. He easily achieves a Good Result, and he therefore augments his result to Superb+1. (After this round, his Reservoir will also drop another level.)\par The director desperately tries to augment his result again, but rolls a Fair result: he\rquote s reached the limit of his ability to stave off defeat. Yardmower Man rearranges the director into a lovely bush, and stares blankly at the outcome. At this point, his Psychic Reservoir drops one more level, as required by the GM for such a taxing action.\par Since he lost one level of Psychic Reservoir augmenting his skill, and another for the difficult Shapeshift action, Yardmower Man is now left with a Terrible Psychic Reservoir; he\rquote d better not try anything this difficult for a while. Also, the GM demands a Good Difficulty level roll against Constitution to avoid any unpleasant side effects from the Batch-5 overdose. Yardmower Man gets a Mediocre result, missing by two levels. The GM smiles at the player, and secretly jots down that the next time he uses Batch-5, he\rquote ll hallucinate that the director has returned to human form and is out to get him\u8230\'c9. \par Yardmower Man may someday drain his Psychic Reservoir fighting someone that isn\rquote t there.\par \par }\pard \sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\b\fs26\kerning1 7.4  Alternate Rules\par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 One of Fudge\rquote s basic premises is that people have different tastes. Here is a collection of alternate rules sections for doing things slightly differently.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.41  Alternate Section 1.4:Character Creation\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Date: December, 1992\par By: Ed Heil\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Instead of creating characters before starting the game, create them as the game progresses.\par The GM assigns a number of skill levels available to a PC during a session. This should be based on how finely the GM defines skills: about 10 to 15 for broad skill-group games, and maybe twice that for fine skill-group games. These may be traded at the regular rate of 3 skill levels = 1 attribute level, or 6 skill levels = 1 gift. Faults may also be taken, subject to GM approval.\par The players start with most of the character sheets blank \emdash  simply write out a brief sentence or two describing the character in a general way. (\ldblquote Jeb is a surly dwarf, a good fighter, who is out to make a name for himself as a mean customer \emdash  and pick up some loot on the way. He likes to talk tough, and doesn\rquote t care much for halflings.\rdblquote )\par As the character is confronted with challenging situations, the player must decide the level of the trait in question. For example, the PCs are confronted with a ruined castle to explore, and all the players state their characters are looking for hidden passageways. At this point, each player must set his PC\rquote s skill in finding hidden passageways (however the GM defines such a trait: Perception attribute, or Find Hidden skill, or Architecture skill, etc.). Those who are not yet willing to set such a trait must stop searching: if you use a trait, you must define it. \par Since setting an initial skill at Fair level uses up two skill levels, and setting it at Superb uses up five levels, one must carefully weigh spending levels on skills as they are used versus saving them for emergency situations.\par As usual, attributes are considered Fair unless altered, and most skills default to Poor. Taking a trait at a level below the default adds to your available skill level pool, of course. However, you may only define a trait as it is used in a game situation.\par Experience points are given out as usual, but EP awarded are reduced by any unused skill levels after each session. That is, if you have two levels left after the first session, and the GM awards you three EP, you only get one more level for the next session, since you already have two levels unused. EP, in this case, can be used either to raise existing skills, as discussed in Section 5.2, Objective Character Development, or they can be used to add new skills, as discussed in this section, above. \par Note that it costs more EPs to raise an existing skill than it does to define a previously undefined skill in this on-the-fly system. EP should be slightly higher under this system than a regular character creation system, perhaps a range of up to ten per session.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.42  Alternate Section 3.2:Diceless Action Resolution\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Date: May, 1995\par By: Reimer Behrends\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 This section handles ways of resolving conflicts without resorting to the use of dice. There are reasons to do away with dice: some people find dice mechanics too intrusive for play; others may want to get rid of randomness altogether.\par However, diceless action resolution is ill-suited to simulation-based gaming, despite the fact that the game can (and should) feel just as real as one with dice. Also, diceless resolution is usually more demanding of the GM than rolling dice to select an outcome. Even more so as there is no hard-and-fast rule for resolving conflicts without dice; instead, some creativity is required of the GM to fill in certain blanks.\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.421  Basics\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The basic idea behind diceless action resolution is simple: the GM decides upon an appropriate outcome, based on player input and the situation at hand. The details of this, however, can be more complicated.\par The idea is to use cause and effect to convey the feeling that whatever happens to the characters is not due to whim, but occurs because of the logic of the situation and the relevant history of everyone involved. It is important that any event (with exceptions, of course) appears to a be a logical effect of the preceding events. There is usually not a single event that is the outcome. The GM has to choose between several possible outcomes \emdash  which may vary wildly in terms of success and failure.\par Consequently, the two most important parts in resolving an action are the reasons for a particular outcome and the consequences of that outcome.\par Reasons are numerous. Foremost among reasons for success and/or failure is of course effective skill. However, a game where a sufficiently skilled character always wins and an incompetent character always fails would be quite boring due to its predictability. So we have to diversify these results, but in a way that doesn\rquote t feel artificial.\par We do this by accounting for other factors besides effective skill. These factors can involve the environment (slipping in a puddle), equipment (a gun that jams at a critical moment), time constraints (defusing a bomb before it goes off), NPC actions (a character stepping in the way), etc. The idea is not to account for all possible factors, just to find one or two reasons that make the outcome seem logical.\par Detailed description is essential to diceless action resolution \emdash  description not only of the environment, but also of the characters. Noting that a character has a Great fencing skill may often suffice, but it is better to add some details (ideally through a character history). Describe style, weaknesses, and strengths, even though they may normally not show up on the character sheet. The same is true for the description of important actions.\par Sometimes a character\rquote s perception (or lack thereof) may result in failure to notice why something happened. If, for instance, the floor suddenly gives way beneath him, he may not be certain as to what caused this to happen: did he step on a trap, or was there an outside agent involved? In this case, the GM will hide some or all of the reasons.\par In addition to reasons, we have to consider consequences: what impact does a particular outcome have on the situation as a whole? The more serious the outcome, the more the reasons for it happening need to be convincing.\par As an extreme example, death of player characters should only occur with ample forewarning of the risks or with really compelling reasons. Of course, jumping off a skyscraper will most likely render a character dead the instant he hits the ground. This is acceptable, because the players understand the logic of the situation. But slipping on a wet rock while crossing a stream \emdash  which can be ascribed to just plain bad luck \emdash  shouldn\rquote t kill a character outright. While it\rquote s true that slipping on a wet rock probably happens more often than jumping off a building, the GM needs to be careful in deciding the consequences of such an action.\par There are many possible results for typical actions. So, lacking clear ideas as to which one is most appropriate \emdash  maybe even torn between clear success and catastrophic failure \emdash  how can this selection be narrowed down?\par There are a few ways to approach the problem, and it is a good idea to reach an agreement with the group before play commences as to what factors will be used. The following list is far from complete, but gives some possibilities:\par 1) Realism: A master archer will hit the target most of the time. But sometimes even he will fail, or even have a streak of bad luck. This is important for maintaining a feeling of realism in the long run. It should also be noted that realism is relative to genre. Chandelier-swinging is likely to succeed in a swashbuckling romp, while it is at best a risky endeavour in a gritty game.\par 2) Drama: Sometimes certain outcomes are dramatically more appropriate than others. This unfortunately depends to a great degree upon individual gaming style and can only be handled briefly here.\par 3) Characterization: Sometimes, a character\rquote s success or failure at a particular task can help to reinforce or develop his character story.\par 4) Theme: By assigning a certain \ldblquote theme\rdblquote  to each scene in the game as it is encountered, actions can be resolved in a way that emphasizes that theme. An example:\par \par [The theme is \ldblquote Combat is dangerous\rdblquote ]\par \par GM: \ldblquote Suddenly, you hear a rustling in the underbrush, and then, out of it, a boar emerges, charging at you.\rdblquote \par Player: \ldblquote I\rquote m not armed! I\rquote ll jump for the branch of the oak next to me and pull myself up to safety.\rdblquote \par \par [While the avoidance of a fight supports the theme, \ldblquote Combat is dangerous,\rdblquote  there are other possibilities that emphasize it better.]\par \par GM: \ldblquote You get hold of the branch, but as you start to pull yourself up, you hear a loud CRACK, and all of a sudden the ground rushes upwards to meet you.\rdblquote \par \par [The situation is now much more dangerous. However, with a bit of luck and the help of the other characters in the group it is still possible to handle it without killing the PC.]\par \par All of the above factors are meta-game issues. This is intentional. These factors contribute towards an interesting game, and one of the points of role-playing is to have an interesting game. Besides, we are already using the in-game factors as cause and effect to convey a natural flow of events so we have to resort to the meta-level here.\par It may look as though there is a lot of arbitrariness on the part of the GM. This is correct to some extent. Some individual decisions will be arbitrary. In the long run it should balance out, especially if the players possess even the slightest creativity. Note also that the GM should always respect player input. If something is going to fail that should normally work, failure should still reflect player input. (For instance, the example above with the breaking branch, where the character technically succeeds, but the branch does not cooperate).\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.422  Balance Of Power\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 There is no need to encumber the GM with all the decisions. The easiest way to hand some power back to the players is to give them a (limited) voice in the decision making process. For this purpose we employ Fudge Points (see Section 1.36).\par By spending one Fudge Point, the player (instead of the GM) can decide the outcome of an action his character is involved in, provided the action is possible and not abusive to the game. (Blowing up an entire building with a cup of gunpowder is implausible, and possibly abusive to the plot). If the action is far beyond the normal skill of the character (given the circumstances), the GM may require expenditure of two or three Fudge Points instead.\par Notice that using Fudge Points also gives the GM more leeway; she need no longer worry too much whether letting a character fail is too harsh, as it is within the power of the player to help his character if need be.\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.423  Combat\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Diceless combat is action resolution with two added complications: the high risk of character death and a considerable amount of action that needs to be synchronized.\par The synchronization part is fairly easy: as in resolution with dice, you can divide the entire combat in rounds of appropriate duration, cycling through all participating characters each round, or use story elements as suggested in Section 4.21.\par Character death is trickier because players dislike losing their characters due to bad luck (be it because of an unlucky die roll or GM whim). The key here is to \ldblquote post warning signs\rdblquote  before dangerous situations occur. These warnings should be subtle, such as the maniacal gleam in the opponent\rquote s eyes just before she launches a wild flurry of attacks. (Hopefully the player will say his character is on the defense, or announce some trick to counter a charge.) A description of the blood dripping from a character\rquote s wrist should warn the player that there may be a slippery puddle on the floor. In other words, prepare reasons for outcomes in advance and \emdash  most important \emdash  announce them to the players.\par If the players maintain some maneuvering space for their characters after such warnings, that should be sufficient to prevent PC death \emdash  though not necessarily PC failure.\par Character death \emdash  and any other drastic result \emdash  is usually due to a series of failures, each pushing the character a step further towards the edge \emdash  but always with opportunity to find a more favourable course of action in between. Unfortunately, in some situations this entire series of failures takes no longer than a few seconds.\par The details of combat interaction are now fairly easy to handle, as they are an extension of normal diceless resolution. However, particular care should be taken to describe actions fully, especially in melee combat. The statement \ldblquote I attack the pirate\rdblquote  is infinitely less informative than saying, \ldblquote I assault the pirate with all I have, even if that means taking a blow or two myself. But I have to get out of here, and that means getting by her and at least wounding her so she can\rquote t follow quickly.\rdblquote \par The object is to give the GM enough data to work with, such as, \ldblquote I\rquote m going to feint towards the left, and if she goes for it, I\rquote ll try to use the opening created to end this business quickly,\rdblquote  or \ldblquote Now that she\rquote s wounded, I\rquote ll play it safe, trying to wear her down.\rdblquote  Statements like these help the GM decide how combat should be resolved much more than a simple, \ldblquote I attack her.\rdblquote \par The key here is to be creative. Everything is possible, so everything should be considered, from a simple rugby tackle to complex tactical maneuvering.\par Bloodshed is an unfortunate but largely unavoidable side effect of combat. Wounds are also important because they may become major factors in the future course of the combat. Thus, wounds must be described and their effects detailed. For example:\par \ldblquote The ball of fire explodes in the centre of the room. You feel a wave of searing heat washing over you, burning your clothes away and scorching your skin. The heat gradually abates, but you still cannot see anything, as the incredible brightness that hurts your eyes is only slowly receding.\rdblquote \par The player should gather from this that his character is temporarily blinded, in severe pain, needing medical attention, in a state of dishabille, and in grave danger if enemies are approaching.\par (This is of course appropriate for a high fantasy game. In a more realistic game, the character is probably charred and dead.)\par Another example, this time a sniper\rquote s bullet hitting the character\rquote s arm:\par \ldblquote Something very hot and painful pierces your left arm. It also jerks you around abruptly, making it hard to maintain balance. Worse, your arm feels totally numb and is probably fairly useless right now. The good news is that they (whoever they are) apparently missed your heart by a few inches.\rdblquote \par And so on. There is no need to be too graphic in describing wounds, though. More important is the description of how the wound affects the character.\par \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.424  Summing Up\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Fudge is ideally suited to diceless action resolution since it\rquote s already simple and word-based. This can set the tone for the amount of description necessary for a diceless game to succeed. Once players and GM get used to diceless Fudge, they\rquote ll find themselves describing their characters and actions in ways they never thought of before \emdash  and the game can be richer and more entertaining for it.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.43  Alternate Section 3.2:Rolling the Dice\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Date: January, 1993\par By: Andy Skinner\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 As a simple variation on any dice technique, allow players who roll a +4 result to roll again. If the result is positive, add it in to the +4 already rolled. If the result is negative or zero, ignore the second roll. This allows a small chance of results up to +8, which can be lifesaving in a dire situation.\par Only a pitiless GM would balance this by requiring additional rolls to see how miserably a person can do on a \endash 4 result, however.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.44  Alternate Section 4.36:Heroic Evasion\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Date: February, 1995\par By: Peter Bonney & Steffan O\rquote Sullivan\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 If a PC is hit, he may reduce the effect of the hit by one wound level by throwing himself heroically out of the way of (at least part of) the blow. However, this heroic evasion will put the fighter at a temporary disadvantage: \endash 2 on the next combat round in addition to any other penalties that may be accrued. This penalty disappears in subsequent rounds, as the hero is able to recover his equilibrium after a brief flurry of wild parrying. This may be repeated, but there is an additional \endash 1 for every turn in succession that this is used.\par For example, D\rquote Artagnan would be hit by Milady for a Light Wound (Hurt result). He heroically evades, taking only a Scratch, but is at \endash 2 on the following round. In this round, he would be Very Hurt, but again he heroically evades, taking instead a Hurt result. The next round he is at \endash 4: \endash 2 for evading this round, an additional \endash 1 for evading two rounds in a row, and \endash 1 for being Hurt. If he can avoid having to evade on the next round, he\rquote ll only be at \endash 1 for being Hurt. Good luck D\rquote Artagnan!\par If the penalty for an heroic evasion drops a fighter\rquote s skill level to below Terrible, he may still take the evasion. But he automatically collapses: his weapon drops from his nerveless fingers and his throat is helplessly exposed to the enemy for an instant death blow if the foe is so minded. A plea for mercy may accompany such an evasion, but the opponent isn\rquote t necessarily bound to honor such a plea.\par Heroic Evasion can be used for major NPCs, too, of course.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 7.45  Alternate Section 4.56:Recording Wounds\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Date: December, 1992\par By: Bernard Hsiung\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Ordinary playing cards can be used to keep track of wounds.

If you have a concept in mind, scan the skill lists that seem most likely to fit your character. A fighter will obviously need to spend some points in Combat skills, and a thief in Covert skills.\par Since you must spend points in at least two skill groups, try to think of what other skills would be helpful \endash  or perhaps simply fun \endash  for your character to have.\par Once you\rquote ve decided which skill groups to choose from, jot down the most appealing skills in these groups. The number of skills you want from a given group will tell you how many points you need to spend in that skill group. For example, if only two or three skills appeal to you from a group, spending 1 or 2 narrowly focused points is sufficient. If you really want eight or ten skills all from the same group, you\rquote re creating a specialist character: you\rquote ll probably have to spend three or four points in that skill group to get that many skills. (Another way to get eight or ten skills, if you don\rquote t mind low skill levels, is to use the \ldblquote trading skills\rdblquote  option.) A Jack of All Trades character rarely spends more than two points in any one group, and is interested in skills from three or more different skill groups.\par Once your skills are chosen, you can then set your attributes, Gifts, and Faults. At that point you\rquote ll easily be able to see what levels your attributes should logically be, and which Gifts and Faults would go most appropriately with your character.\par It\rquote s best to consult with the Gamemaster and the other players when creating characters. This can prevent problems with characters that are unsuited for the planned campaign, or PCs that encroach on one another\rquote s \ldblquote spotlight\rdblquote  time because their skills and abilities compete with rather than complement those of the other characters.

(The GM may allow more or fewer free attribute levels \endash  see Campaign Power Levels in the online version of Five-point Fudge.)\par In addition, players may trade levels \endash  that is, lower an attribute to Mediocre in order to raise one other attribute one level, and so on.  Also, subject to GM approval, a character may raise an attribute by taking an additional Fault, or by foregoing one of the two free Gifts.\par Conversely, a player may forego one of his free two attribute levels in order to take an extra Gift \endash  again, subject to GM approval.\par Attributes are not linked to skills in this game.  The player is encouraged to choose attribute levels which make sense, given his skill list. For example, three or more points spent between Combat, Scouting and Athletic skills means that the character would logically be above average in Strength, Agility, and/or Health. If the player decides not to raise at least one of these attributes above Fair, he should have a good story as to why they are abnormally low.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Using Attributes\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Attributes are used for three things in the game:\par \bullet  As very broad skills.

In these cases, the GM will choose the closest attribute and have the player roll versus the attribute.\par \bullet  In certain opposed actions, such as attempting to sneak by a guard (Move Quietly skill vs. Perception attribute) or a swindle attempt (Con skill vs. Reasoning attribute) or an attempt to strangle someone (Strength attribute vs. Health attribute). The GM will think of other cases readily.\par \bullet  As a broad handle on who the character is.

John Ross. (GURPS is a registered trademark of Steve Jackson Games.) \par GURPS Hedge Magic can be found at:\par http://www.io.com/~sjohn/hedge.htm\par Hedge Magic is the \ldblquote peasant\rdblquote  version of magic: hedgerow witches and village wizards concocting herbal potions, creating charms, nullifying (or, alas, casting) curses, etc.\par You may spend up to four points in the Hedge Magic group, but only as many points as you have levels of the Magic Talent: Hedge Magic Gift. That is, if you take only one level of Magic Talent: Hedge Magic Gift, you may only spend one point on Hedge Magic skills.\par The skill list for Hedge Magic follows, and is treated like any other skill group. That is, one point spent in Hedge Magic allows you to choose 3 skills at Fair and 1 at Mediocre, etc. Each skill is a mundane skill found in other skill groups \emdash  if you learn it in the Hedge Magic group, there is no need to learn it from another group.\par You may use a mundane skill from this group without applying Hedge Magic. But if you use Hedge Magic, you can accomplish more than you could otherwise. Hedge Magic is not flashy magic \emdash  you\rquote ll never see major magical effects from it. It\rquote s nonetheless effective in what it tries to do.\par Hedge Magic is fatiguing, however \emdash  your Health attribute drops one level, temporarily, for each use. If your Health level falls below Terrible, you are exhausted and collapse \emdash  treat as the fatigue equivalent of \ldblquote Incapacitated.\rdblquote  A level of fatigued Health is regained simply by resting 15 minutes.\par Another possible downside to Hedge Magic is that the results may be perceived as magical, which, depending on the situation, may get the caster in trouble.\par The following mundane skills are the only ones which may be enhanced by Hedge Magic, unless the GM permits otherwise. Those without descriptions are simply assumed to provide enhanced results.\par Animal Handling\par Astrology: fortune telling for other folk \emdash  grants no inkling of your own future.\par Camouflage: if you don\rquote t want to be seen, you\rquote re very hard to spot.\par Cooking: tasty, nourishing, mildly healing.\par Counseling: your sympathetic ear and wise advise can soothe troubled souls.\par Craft: most of the craft skills, such as Pottery, Smithy, Tailor, etc., allow you to make superior quality items more quickly. These items are of exceptional quality, but are not really magic items\u8230\'c9 or are they?\par Detect Lies\par Farming: a very common use of hedge magic, you can bless or curse crops: increased yield, faster growth, etc. \emdash  or the opposite.\par First aid: you can stop bleeding with a touch, and enable the severely injured to survive until appropriate care is available.\par Herb Lore: the archetypal hedge magic skill: preparation of magical concoctions. While not as potent as alchemical elixirs, they are quicker to make. Common potions include healing, sleep, love, charisma, strength, endurance, etc. \emdash  ask the GM what\rquote s possible. Use Poisons for harmful potions.\par Medicine: expeditious and efficacious healing.\par Move Quietly\par Poisons: your poisons are more potent, faster acting, and harder to detect. Shame on you.\par Storytelling: you can enthrall an audience, and even sway their mood to your purposes.\par Tracking\par Veterinarian: expeditious and efficacious healing. For evil hedge witches, this is also the skill used to sicken animals, a common complaint in former days.\par Weather Sense: you\rquote re remarkably accurate.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Scholarly Magic\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Scholarly Magic is the \ldblquote upper class\rdblquote  version of magic: sorcerers in towers poring over ancient tomes, wizards roaming the world seeking out spell-crafters and new sources of power, colleges of magicians teaching apprentices while debating amongst themselves the merits of this spell or that, etc.\par A sample Scholarly Magic system is presented below. It\rquote s a flexible magic system, with no preset spell list, and thus leaves a lot of decisions up to the GM. Gamemasters are welcome to substitute any other magic system of choice.

If you spend only one Gift on Magic Talent: Scholarly Magic, you may only spend one point on Scholarly Magic skills. Note that Scholarly Magic skills cost more; see below.\par Characters without Magical Talent may learn the Thaumatology Knowledge Skill instead.

(PCs should be allowed to take the Knowledge Skill version of Alchemy, which allows them to recognize various alchemical potions and know something about the procedures and ingredients involved in making them, but not actually create magical elixirs.)\par The GM may also decide that each culture in the game world knows only a few of the many \ldblquote flavors\rdblquote  of Scholarly Magic. For example, Shamanism may be restricted to the \ldblquote primitive\rdblquote  tribes on the jungle continent, or to the horse nomads on the great steppes. Another culture may know Mesmerism, but outlaw its use.

There are three categories of magic items: charms and talismans, with long-lasting but subtle magic; \ldblquote One-shot\rdblquote  items such as scrolls that release their magical effect all at once (some may be enchanted to work more than once, but will stop working under pre-set conditions, or after a set number of magical feats are performed); and permanent magical items, such as magical swords, cloaks of flying, and the like. \ldblquote Magic vessels\rdblquote  are permanent enchanted items that are relatively easy to create; they collect and store mana (magical power; see below) for later use, providing scholarly mages with a \ldblquote magic battery\rquote \rquote  of sorts.\par In-Game Requirements: As with alchemy, artificing requires lengthy rites. Even a simple talisman or charm takes several weeks to ritually prepare, although actually embuing it with magical power may require only a short ceremony and a GM-determined expenditure of mana. Powerful, permanent enchantments require the item to be specifically created and prepared with the enchantment in mind, and may require the item to be crafted out of rare or precious materials. It\rquote s not enough to take any old sword and slap an ever-sharp enchantment on it; the sword must be forged in a prescribed manner, with rituals of artificing and enchantment performed on it throughout its creation. Artificing also requires much mana, which is usually expended in several stages throughout the artificing process.\par Restrictions: Artificing requires the mage to also be skilled in the type of magic bestowed on the item. A wand that turns the target into a frog requires the Transmutation skill; a bag of winds requires the Elemental skill; and so on. Magical scrolls that allow the reader to cast spells require two skills; the Rune skill (for knowing the symbols to use to \ldblquote write\rdblquote  the spell on the scroll) and the appropriate magic type skill (Mesmerism for a sleep spell, etc.). The GM may also require the artificer to be skilled in crafting the item to be enchanted. Magic swords may need an Artificer who is also a swordsmith (Smithy professional skill). If the artificer collaborates with another magician or with a skilled craftsman in creating an enchanted item, each participant must match or exceed the Difficulty Level set by the GM at each stage of the artificing in order for the final enchantment to work.\par Note:The ability to create magic vessels is included in the Artificing skill, as the ability to store mana in an enchanted item is at the heart of all artificing.\par \par }\pard \sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Conjuration:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  Creating objects (even creatures!) out of \ldblquote thin air\rdblquote  \endash  or making objects disappear.\par }\pard \li720\sa120\sl240\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\faauto\rin0\lin720\itap0 {\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Magical Feats: A conjurer can produce magical energy (in the form of heat, or light, or both) or non-magical items (such as water, air, food, or anything else the GM allows), or creatures (normal animals, magical creatures, and even sentient creatures).

Other runes act more like spells, with the drawing of the rune in the prescribed manner being the only ritual required to perform the magical feat associated with that rune. Most Artificers are well versed in runes, as runes are used in preparing spell scrolls and in many other magical items. Artificing can also be used to make a rune and its effects more permanent. For example, a Sigil of Warding drawn above the archway to a room would repel an intruder only once, unless applied in conjunction with the Artificing skill.\par In-Game Requirements: The appropriate rune must be carefully and correctly drawn.

If Health level falls below Terrible, the character is exhausted and collapses \emdash  treat as the fatigue equivalent of \ldblquote Incapacitated.\rdblquote  A level of fatigued Health is regained simply by resting 15 minutes.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Performing Magical Feats\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 When a character wishes to perform magic, the player should describe to the Gamemaster the magical results the character wishes to achieve. The more detail included in the description, the better. Scholarly magic depends heavily on the magician\rquote s concentration and clarity of thought, and if the player isn\rquote t paying much attention to what the character wishes to accomplish, the GM may assume the character isn\rquote t, either.\par The player may also describe the magician character\rquote s actions, and aspects of the ritual being used to perform the magic feat, if desired. Including poetic incantations (especially if it\rquote s good poetry) and other \ldblquote flavor\rdblquote  in the description of the ritual may be worth bonuses to the character\rquote s skill.\par There are several aspects that should be considered for each magical feat:\par \bullet  Skill required (Difficulty Level)\par \bullet  Mana required (power points that will be used)\par \bullet  Time to perform (from an instant to years)\par \bullet  Materials required (if any)\par \bullet  Optional modifying circumstances (lots possible)\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Skill: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The more complex the desired results, the higher the Difficulty Level the GM should set for a magical feat. Difficulty Levels start at Fair for simple magic, such as creating \endash  but not controlling \endash  fire, or speaking with a spirit that\rquote s already \ldblquote awake\rdblquote  and interested in communicating. Difficulty can range up to Legendary or even beyond, for god-like magical feats. Some \ldblquote trivial\rdblquote magic may have Difficulty Levels of Mediocre, but any magic requiring power points should be of at least Fair Difficulty.\par Once the Difficulty Level is set, the player rolls against the magician\rquote s Scholarly Magic skill. Use the lowest skill if the feat requires more than one Scholarly Magic skill.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Example:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  Enchanting a Staff of Dragon Summoning and Control requires skill in Artificing, Conjuration, and Mesmerism. An enchanter with Artificing: Mediocre, Conjuration: Fair, and Mesmerism: Good would roll on a skill level of Mediocre.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Mana:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  The more powerful or all-encompassing the desired results, the more power points will be required. \ldblquote Trivial\rdblquote  magic may require so little mana that power point use isn\rquote t even tracked. This doesn\rquote t mean a mage can go around popping off trivial spells all day, though, since even trivial spells requiring no power points will fatigue the mage.\par Note that the Difficulty Level and the mana required are not related; one measures complexity, the other power. Creating a small colored flame that dances in a pattern that recreates an ancient battle between wizards may be of Legendary Difficulty, but require only one power point.\par Note also that some magical feats require more power points than any but the most Legendary Wizards have access to. Such feats are possible, either through pooling the power points of more than one magician, or drawing on \ldblquote mana vessels\rdblquote  containing stored power points (see Artificing, above). Some rare materials are natural \ldblquote mana vessels.\rdblquote  \par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Time: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Generally speaking, the more complex the magical feat desired, the greater the time required in preparing. This is usually true of powerful spells as well. Complex, powerful spells should take a lot of time to prepare. You can trade Time for Difficulty Level, if you wish. The less time you take in preparing the magical incantation, enchantment, or other feat, the greater the Difficulty Level. Likewise, increasing the preparation and casting time may, at the GM\rquote s option, lower the Difficulty Level.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Materials:}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1  If the GM wishes, magical feats may require the use of materials related to the effects desired; sulphur or coal for fire, a feather for a flying spell, and so on. Some magical feats may be performed with nothing more than the magician\rquote s concentration or some words of power; others may require rare and precious materials.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Modifiers: }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The GM may apply any modifiers desired. Examples include bonuses for using special materials (or using materials at all if not normally required); for performing magic in naturally magical surroundings; for applying any \ldblquote laws of magic\rdblquote  the GM allows (if they have the Wizardry skill). Penalties may be applied for distracting circumstances, or the GM may require a Willpower roll for the mage to avoid becoming distracted and possibly losing control of the magic he\rquote s wielding.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Determining Results\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 The GM judges whether a feat is within the character\rquote s capabilities \endash  if not, she should warn the player that attempting greater magics than the character is ready for is dangerous. The GM also determines what the actual result will be. Magic in Fantasy Fudge is an art, not a science; and the same \ldblquote spell\rdblquote  cast in the same way may have varying results.\par In general, the greater the success in performing a magical feat, the closer to the desired effects the results will be. Spectacular successes may carry unexpected benefits, such as less time required to cast, lower power point cost, and the like. Abysmal failures should be spectacular, as well. Use your imagination, but don\rquote t allow the results to outright kill the character (unless he\rquote s a sorcerer)! Less abysmal failures will produce unexpected and possibly unwanted results, including greater power point cost with little or nothing to show for it.\par \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Spell Lists\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 It\rquote s a good idea to take some time before play to work out some \ldblquote standard\rdblquote  spells a scholarly mage is likely to use. Ask the player what spells the character is likely to have sought out, and work out some sample Difficulty Levels, Mana costs,  and required time and materials for those spells. Feel free to \ldblquote steal\rdblquote  spells from other games to help build a spell list. Consider the spell\rquote s desired affect rather than the actual game mechanics used in the game it was designed for, and base the difficulty and power levels on that.\par Spell descriptions should be considered guidelines rather than strict definitions of spell effects and costs.

For example, a Good result may reduce one wound by one wound level, while a Superb result could heal an injured character entirely.\par On a Fair or Mediocre result, the favor simply isn\rquote t granted. On a Poor or worse result, the deity may be angry with the cleric. The GM should consider the character\rquote s recent actions, especially in regard to the cleric\rquote s religious beliefs. If there are any reasons for the cleric\rquote s deity to be less than satisfied with service rendered, this is the time for that to become abundantly clear.

They resemble humanoid birds, with large, curved beaks and offset eyes. Feathers cover their head, upper torso and arms. Their plumage is generally dark or mottled and unkempt and greasy. Many Rathent have hands ending talon-like claws. Most Rathent have human-like leg structure. Rare individuals will have bird-like legs or vestigial wings, and are generally regarded as gruk (retard or throwback). This is a reflection of cultural bias rather than actual ability or intelligence.\par The structure of Rathent society is loosely tribal with the strongest or most cunning being the skwarka (chieftain). The skwarka leads the tribe in battle and receives the most prestige and breeding privileges.\par Rathent are extremely protective of their females, as they have a relatively low birthrate. Only one in five members of a typical Rathent tribe are female.\par Rathent males serve as hunters and generally engage in banditry, thievery, and murder to eke out an existence. They are cowardly scavengers by nature and will feed on carrion with glee when there is nothing better.\par Most Rathent provide only for themselves, but offer tribute to the skwarka and his harem. Warriors that do not pay tribute regularly to the skwarka are either exiled or more likely killed.\par Rathent may be encountered in semi-civilized areas on the outskirts of forests and mountains. Their villages are clusters of rude tree houses similar to nests in structure. The skwarka\rquote s nest is the largest and centrally located, and is built into the largest tree available.\par Rathent have fair craftsmanship skills, but rarely produce anything of exceptional quality. Most of their weaponry is scavenged or stolen. When left to their own means they will produce javelins, war darts, and spears. Rathent armor is usually cobbled together from bits and pieces scavenged in their raids.\par Some Rathent have an innate talent for simple magic. Clerical Magic and Hedge Magic is most common. Scholarly Magic (Elementalism or Necromancy) is also possible, but no Rathent will have more than one level of the Magical Talent: Scholarly Magic Gift. Rathents with Magical Talent are known as kuzkwa. Most are female. All magically talented Rathent are sterile and considered sexless. Many are also albino. These Rathent serve as shamans and spiritual advisors.\par Rathent spirituality is a grim affair centered around the malevolent figure Kzukwa-skwark (Old Lord Dread). Homage is paid to this fearsome entity by murdering as many non-Rathent as possible. This ensures that the afterlife will be only moderately painful, rather than an eternity of anguish and torture.\par Rathent have an irrational attraction to shiny objects, and will often quarrel over relatively useless objects that glitter.\par }{\i\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 \emdash  Sedge Lewis\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 \par }{\b\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Ratlings\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\kerning1 Attributes (individuals may vary):\par \tab Reasoning:\tab Mediocre\par \tab Perception:\tab Fair\par \tab Willpower:\tab Mediocre\par \tab Strength:\tab Fair\par \tab Agility:\tab Good\par \tab Health:\tab Mediocre\par Scale:\tab \endash 1 (or less)\par Combat Skill:\tab Fair\par Attacks:\tab Claws or Bite\par Damage Factors (including Scale):\par \tab Offensive:\tab +0 (claws), +1 (bite)\par \tab Defensive:\tab \endash 1\par Ratlings are small humanoid creatures whose head, claws and tail look like those of a rat. Their legs are also more ratlike than human. Ratlings have a low life expectancy due to disease resulting from poor living conditions. Ratlings can speak as well as humans, and usually speak the local dominant language. Their claws are dexterous enough to allow a Ratling to use equipment made for humans.\par Ratlings were created by a Grand Mage who later allowed his experiments to leave his laboratory. In the few years since their creation, the Ratlings have established themselves amid the slums and backways of the city.\par The GM may involve Ratlings in the city\rquote s political scene if desired. Examples: The local ruler has placed a bounty on Ratling skins; Ratlings are active in the Thieves\rquote  or Beggars\rquote  Guilds; etc.\par The GM may adjust Ratlings to be smaller and more ratlike, if she likes.

Corpses are versatile, readily available, and the once-living bones lend themselves well to enchantment. A lesser nether-spirit is bound to the dead bones, animating them and providing a rudimentary, malevolent intelligence. The resulting creatures need no sustenance, are infinitely patient, and obey the commands of their creators without question. They are often set to guard tombs, fortresses, and hiding places of all sorts.\par The Restless Dead appear as piles of old bones scattered around the places they guard. They have no odor (prior to enchantment, the corpses are usually stripped of all flesh by being placed onto anthills or in maggot pits). It takes a Perception roll of Great or above to detect the thin webwork of sigils covering the bones from any distance.\par When anyone or anything comes near, the bones reassemble into malevolent, skeletal forms and spring into action.\par Though not terribly strong, the Restless Dead are agile and tenacious.
